We are such villains\nWe would tell ourselves anything\nWe want to hear, if we are willing\nTo listen is to learn\nThen too much is what we deserve\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd how come when we say that we do\nWe don't\nPray to anybody you want\nWe won't\n[Chorus]\nBut if we're the ones to blame then the fruit\nShouldn't taste so good, we were used\nUsed to thinking we got nothing to lose\nWe're losing everything but the truth\nWalking straight into a roadblock\nEnding left, here bending\nYour point of view was chosen by the serpent's ruse\n\n[Verse 2]\nWith all its do's and don'ts\nThe future is an empty promise\nUnconcerned and so tired of waiting\nWe could sell it wooden horses\nFull of nightmares and when they open\nThis all might recompose\nThere's no going back to the good old days\nIt's just a phase bring in some new life\nArchaism is a dusty road leading us back to nowhere\n\n[Chorus]\nIf we're the ones to blame then the fruit\nShouldn't taste so good, we were used\nUsed to thinking we got nothing to lose\nWe're losing everything but the truth\nWalking straight into a roadblock\nEnding left, here bending\nYour point of view was chosen by the serpent's ruse\nYou might also like[Outro]\nAnd how come when we say we do, we don't\nHow come when we say we will, we won't1Embed"
