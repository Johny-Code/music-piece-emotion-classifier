As we plot your downfall in the nearest aisle\nThey're nailing up the coffin but you're smiling as you go\nCoining in to nothing, it's all part of the freak show\nWalk in my shadow\nRitual exclusion is just a part of everything\nAnd tolerance depends upon the song you sing\nWho's poison arrow?\nAnd if you dance, you command no more respect\nNow we'll have to find some other way to keep the children safe\nEve's been at the drawing board to segregate the human race\nFalling from an altercation, you're put in a situation\nDenied access to the one thing bound to stop you going under\nNow you'll have to face tomorrow with no hope to beg or borrow\nOnce you count it up you know you're gonna find it's not enough\nYour only hope's to cook the books, Pray the man don't choose to look you upYou might also likeEmbed"
