Casey]\nA'ight, so look (No)\nI know you think everything I say (Yeah)\nI just be talkin' (Oh)\nIt's a lotta B.S, I know (We keep, we keep, we keep, we keep, yeah, oh)\nBut we gotta stop goin' (Oh, we keep, we keep, we keep, we keep, yeah)\nBack and forth, back and forth\nUp and down, up and down\n'Round, 'round, 'round and 'round (No, no)\nIf it's up to me\nI'll make it happen\n[Chorus: Jagged Edge & (B. Casey)]\nBaby, we be goin' 'round and 'round and 'round\nIt's time to lock it down (Time to lock it down)\nAnd I'm givin' up them girls on other sides of town\nOnly wantin' you to be around\nBaby, we be goin' 'round and 'round and 'round\nIt's time to settle down\nGivin' up them girls on other sides of town\nAnd justify this love that I found\nWe be goin' 'round and 'round and 'round\n\n[Verse 1: B. Casey & Jagged Edge]\nIf a tornado swept through towns\nWe'd be goin' 'round and 'round\nSo many years that we stayed down\nYou sound like no other sound (No)\nIf I described my heart right now (No)\nGotta turn my love side down (Oh)\nI'm on my knees, front of you right now\nAnd I wanna make you mine (Ooh, ooh, ooh)\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Wingo, Jagged Edge & B. Casey]\nWhere will this road lead us right now?\nWhere we'll stop, nobody knows\nWe'll reach our pot of gold somehow\nJust keep holdin' on\nLike a merry-go-round\nWe keep, goin' around and 'round\nWe keep, we keep goin' 'round and 'round\nAnd I'm ready when you are, to let my game go (Oh)\nYou might also like[Chorus: Jagged Edge & (B. Casey)]\nBaby, we be goin' 'round and 'round and 'round\nIt's time to lock it down (Time to lock it down)\nAnd I'm givin' up them girls on other sides of town (Yeah, yeah)\nOnly wantin' you to be around ('Round, 'round, 'round, woah)\nBaby, we be goin' 'round and 'round and 'round\nIt's time to settle down (Time to settle down)\nGivin' up them girls on other sides of town\nAnd justify this love that I found (Hey, hey, hey)\nWe be goin' 'round and 'round and 'round\n\n[Verse 2: B. Casey]\nIt's like the spokes on an old '64\nWe be goin' 'round and 'round\nNo one but you can hold this crown\nSo here's the plan, girl\nI'm tradin' in my J's for some flip-flops\nI'm spendin' all my nights here with you\nWe so wrapped up in this beat like it's hip-hop\nI'm never gonna let you go\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Wingo, Jagged Edge & B. Casey]\nWhere will this road lead us right now?\nWhere we'll stop, nobody knows\nWe'll reach our pot of gold somehow\nJust keep holdin' on\nLike a merry-go-round\nWe keep, goin' around and 'round\nWe keep, we keep goin' 'round and 'round\nAnd I'm ready when you are, to let my game go (Oh)\n[Chorus: Jagged Edge & (B. Casey)]\nBaby, we be goin' 'round and 'round and 'round\nIt's time to lock it down (Time to settle down)\nAnd I'm givin' up them girls on other sides of town\nOnly wantin' you to be around (Only wantin' you to be around)\nBaby, we be goin' 'round and 'round and 'round (Oh, yeah)\nIt's time to settle down (Yeah)\nGivin' up them girls on other sides of town (Other sides of town)\nAnd justify this love that I found\nWe be goin' 'round and 'round and 'round (We be goin' 'round)\n\n[Bridge: Wingo, Jagged Edge & B. Casey]\nBaby, the storm is over (Ooh)\nBeen through our worst together\nStoppin' us now, no ups and downs (Ooh)\nWe ain't goin' 'round and 'round no more, woah\n\n[Chorus: Jagged Edge & (B. Casey)]\nWe be goin' 'round and 'round and 'round\nIt's time to lock it down (Time to lock it down)\nAnd I'm givin' up them girls on other sides of town (Baby, yeah)\nOnly wantin' you to be around (Eh-hey)\nBaby, we be goin' 'round and 'round and 'round (I'm givin' up my black book and numbers, ooh)\nIt's time to settle down (I'm givin' you the love you deserve)\nGivin' up them girls on other sides of town (You ain't gotta worry about the others)\nAnd justify this love that I found (I'll cut 'em all loose and that's my word, yeah)\nWe be goin' 'round and 'round and 'round (Ooh)Embed"
