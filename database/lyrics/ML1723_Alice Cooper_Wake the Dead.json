Sick...)\nYou wake up every morning thinking everything's okay\nBut if by chance you walk my way you just may seal your fate\nGive me a redhead, give me a brunette, send a blonde to me\nWhen I unwind I'm colour blind, they're all the same to me\n(Sick... Sick...)\n\nShake my head, wake the dead\nShake my head, wake the dead\nRun for your life, you better run for your life\nRun for your life, you gotta run for your life\n\nI just do the things I do, it's natural to me\nThere's no rhyme or reason for my odd insanity\nYou don't know what's going on inside of me\nYou don't wanna know\nWhat's going through my mind, yeah yeah yeah\n\nShake my head, wake the dead\nShake my head, wake the dead\nShake my head, wake the dead\nShake my head, wake the dead\nRun for your life you better run for your life\nRun for your life you gotta run for your life\n(You gotta... you gotta... you gotta... you gotta...\nYou gotta... wake up wake up, you gotta... wake up wake up\nWake up wake up, wake up wake up, wake up wake up\nWake up wake up, wake up wake up, wake up wake up\nWake up wake up)You might also likeEmbed"
