No one cares\nEveryone is guilty\nFucked up, don't know why, you poor little boy\n\n[Chorus]\nWe are all of walking abortions\nShalom shalom, we all love our children\nWe all are of walking abortions\nShalom shalom, there are no horizons\n\n[Verse 2]\nMussolini hangs from a butcher's hook\nHitler reprised in the worm of your soul\nHorthy's corpse screened to a million\nTiso revived, the horror of a bullfight\n\nFragments of uniforms, open black ruins\nA moral conscience - you've no wounds to show\nSo, wash your car in your 'X' baseball shoes\n\n[Chorus]\nWe are all of walking abortions\nShalom shalom, we all love our children\nWe all are of walking abortions\nShalom shalom, there are no horizons\nYou might also like[Outro]\nLittle people in little houses\nLike maggots - small, blind, and worthless\nThe massacred innocent blood stains us all\n\nWho's responsible? You fucking are\nWho's responsible? You fucking are\nWho's responsible? You fucking are\nWho's responsible? You fucking are\nWho's responsible?2Embed"
