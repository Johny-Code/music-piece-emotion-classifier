Absolutely nothing, come on\n\n[Verse 1]\nWar is something that i despise\nFor it means destruction of innocent lives\nAnd thousands words in mothers' cry\nWhen their son's go out to fight to give their lives\n[Chorus 1]\n\n[Chorus 2]\nWar\nIt ain't nothing but a heart-breaker\nWar\nFriend only to the undertaker\n\n[Verse 2]\nWar is the enemy of all mankind\nThe thought of war it just blows my mind\nHanded down from generation to generation\nInduction, destruction, who wants to die?\n\n[Chorus 1]\n\n[Chorus 2]\n\n[Verse 3]\nWar has shattered many young men's dreams\nMade them disabled bitter and mean\nLife is too precious to be fighting wars each day\nWar can't give life it can only take it away\n\n[Chorus 1]\nYou might also like[Verse 4]\nPeace, love and understanding it all\nThere must be some place for these things today\nThey say we must fight to keep our freedom\nBut lord there's gotta be another way that's better than\n\n[Chorus 1][x2]\n\n[Outro]\nI'm talking about warEmbed"
