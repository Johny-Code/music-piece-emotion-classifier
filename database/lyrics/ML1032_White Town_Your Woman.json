I don't know\nBut I'll soon find out, that's for sure\nWhy did you play me this way?\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWell, I guess what you say is true\nI could never be the right kind of girl for you\n\n[Chorus]\nI could never be your woman\nI could never be your woman\nI could never be your woman\nI could never be your woman\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nWell, I guess what they say is true\nI could never spend my life with a man like you\n\n[Chorus]\nI could never be your woman\nI could never be your woman\nI could never be your woman\nI could never be your woman24Embed"
