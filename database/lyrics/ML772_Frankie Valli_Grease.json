It's just a cryin' shame\nTheir lips are lyin', only real is real\nWe stop the fight right now, we got to be what we feel\nGrease is the word\n[Chorus]\nGrease is the word, is the word that you heard\nIt's got a groove, it's got a meaning\nGrease is the time, is the place, is the motion\nGrease is the way we are feeling\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe take the pressure and we throw away\nConventionality belongs to yesterday\nThere is a chance that we can make it so far\nWe start believin' now that we can be who we are\nGrease is the word\n\n[Chorus]\nGrease is the word, is the word that you heard\nIt's got a groove, it's got a meaning\nGrease is the time, is the place, is the motion\nGrease is the way we are feeling\n\n[Bridge]\nThis is a life of illusion, wrapped up in trouble\nLaced with confusion - what're we doin' here?\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe take the pressure and we throw away\nConventionality belongs to yesterday\nThere is a chance that we can make it so far\nWe start believin' now that we can be who we are\nGrease is the word\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nGrease is the word, is the word that you heard\nIt's got a groove, it's got a meaning\nGrease is the time, is the place, is the motion\nGrease is the way we are feeling\n\n[Drum Break]\n\n[Chorus]\nGrease is the word, is the word that you heard\nIt's got a groove, it's got a meaning\nGrease is the time, is the place, is the motion\nGrease is the way we are feeling\n\n[Outro]\nGrease is the word\nIs the word, is the word\nIs the word, is the word\nIs the word, is the word\nIs the word, is the word6Embed"
