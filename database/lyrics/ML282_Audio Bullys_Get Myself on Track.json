Will leave you empty\nAnd he's right, and I've done plenty\nSometimes I wonder what the lord sent me\nShit\nFulfill your dreams, keep up the schemes\nYou've got your family you've got your team\nStay on top and learn from what you've seen\nCuz if there's dirt it can always be clean\nThe future looks much brighter then those bad yesterdays\nNot sayin' it was all bad but tomorrow's another day\nThe future looks much brighter then those bad yesterdays\nNot sayin' it was all bad but tomorrow's another day\n\nI need to get myself on track\nCuz the bangs underneath my eyes are lookin' black\nPressure comin' down could result in gettin' slacked\nBut I gotta stop the demons from gettin' on my back\nNight time cruise into daytime\nAnd everybody's hanging where I'm looking for the next line\nThrow it all up continue to shine somehow\nNext thing now\n\nLet the beats go out\nWhat's happening now\nSomehow, someway, next day, what do you say?\n\nThe future looks much brighter then those bad yesterdays\nNot sayin' it was all bad but tomorrow's another day\nThe future looks much brighter then those bad yesterdays\nNot sayin' it was all bad but tomorrow's another day\n\nI need to make myself a plan\nCuz I don't wanna end up an angry man\nLookin' in my past and thinkin', damn\nForty years old with nothing in my hand\nClose your palm it could slip like sand\nIf you don't respect and understand\nWhat's been put out in front of you\nStop a little while let me? What I'm comin' to\nGot some stuff that I don't wanna hand to you\nSo I'm sittin' in my laugh for a month or two\nPayday, Friday, time to wash all your worries away\nNow all listen in to the music we play\nLike Sinatra, we do it our way\nYou might also like(Your way, my way, whos way?)\n\nThe future looks much brighter then those bad yesterdays\nNot sayin' it was all bad but tomorrow's another day\nThe future looks much brighter then those bad yesterdays\nNot sayin' it was all bad but tomorrow's another dayEmbed"
