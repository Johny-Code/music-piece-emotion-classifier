(Forgotten)\n[Chorus]\nTake hold of my hand\nFor you are no longer alone\nWalk with me in hell\n\n[Verse 2]\nPray for solace\nPray for resolve, pray for a savior\nPray for deliverance, some kind of purpose\nA glimpse of a light in this void of existence\nNow witness the end of an age\nHope dies in hands of believers\nWho seek the truth in the liar's eye!\n\n[Chorus]\nTake hold of my hand\nFor you are no longer alone\nWalk with me in hell\n\n[Bridge]\nWalk with me in hell\nWalk with me in hell\nWalk with me in hell\nWalk with me in hell\nWalk with me in hell\nYou might also like[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Outro]\nTake hold of my hand\nFor you are no longer alone\nWalk with me in hell\nWalk with me in hell\nWalk with me in hell\nYou're never alone\nYou're never alone\nYou're never alone\nYou're never alone\nYou're never alone\nWalk with me in hell11Embed"
