I'm paranoid?\nWell, I nearly choked and no more of that crap\nYou cannot break someone who's just been broken\nYou can't break somebody who's just been broken\nSo take me now, I'm naked\nAs you watch, I'll let you take it\nMaybe then you'll love me and stop looking at the other girls\nYou said I'm paranoid? Well paranoid\nI nearly choked\nNo more of that crap\nYou cannot break somebody who's just been broken\nYou can't break somebody who's just been broken\nI don't need you, I don't want your words\nMaybe if I skip my dinner\nMake myself pretty and thinner\nThen I think he'll love me and stop looking at those other girls1Embed"
