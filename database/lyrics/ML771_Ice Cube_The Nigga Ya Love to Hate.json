It\u2019s the nigga you love to hate\n(Fuck you Ice Cube!)\n(Ay yo baby, your mother warned you about me)\nIt's the nigga you love to hate\n(Yo, you ain\u2019t doin' nothin' positive!\nYo, you ain\u2019t doin' nothin 'positive for the brothers, what you gotta say for yourself?)\n(You don't like how I'm living? Well, fuck you)\n\n[Verse 2: Ice Cube]\nOnce again it's on, the motherfucking psycho\nIce Cube the bitch-killer, cap-peeler\nYo, running through the line like Bo, there's no pot to piss in\nI put my fist in\nNow, who do ya love to hate?\nCause I talk shit and down the eight-ball 'cause I don't fake\nYou're begging I fall off\nThe crossover, might as well cut them balls off\nAnd get your ass ready for the Lenching\nThe Mob is dropping common sense and\nWe'll gank in the pen', we'll shank\nAny Tom, Dick and Hank, and get the ass spanked\nIt ain't about how right or wrong you live, but how long you live\nI ain't with the bullshit\nI meet mo' bitches, mo' hoes\nDon't wanna sleep, so I keep popping No-Doz\nAnd tell the young people what they gotta know\n'Cause I hate when niggas gotta live low\nAnd if you're locked up I dedicate my stylin'\nFrom San Quentin to Rikers Island\nWe got 'em afraid of the funky shit\nI like to clown so pump up the sound\nIn your Jeep, make the old ladies say\n\"Oh my god \u2014 brake, it's the nigga ya love to hate\"\nYou might also like[Hook]\n(Fuck you Ice Cube)\nYeah come on fool, it\u2019s the nigga you love to hate\n(Fuck you Ice Cube)\nYeah, what up, punk? It\u2019s the nigga you love to hate\n[Yo, who the fuck you think you are callin' us bitches. You ain\u2019t all that, all I hear is this bitch. I ain\u2019t nobody\u2019s bitch]\nA bitch is a...ohhhh\n\n[Verse 3: Ice Cube]\nSoul Train done lost they soul\nJust call it train cause the bitches look like hoes\nI see a lotta others damn\nIt almost look like the Bandstand\nYou ask me: \"did I like Arsenio?\"\nAbout as much as the Bicentennial\nI don't give a fuck about dissing these fools\n'Cause they all scared of the Ice Cube\nAnd what I say, what I portray and all that\nAnd ain't even seen the gat\nI don't wanna see no dancing\nI'm sick of that shit -- listen to the hit\n'Cause yo if I look and see another brother\nOn the video trying to out-dance each other\nI'ma tell T-Bone to pass the bottle\nAnd don't give me that shit about role model\nIt ain't wise to chastise and preach\nJust open the eyes of each\n'Cause laws are made to be broken up\nWhat niggas need to do is start loc-ing up\nAnd build mold and fold theyself into shape\nOf the nigga you love to hate15Embed"
