Can't catch me\n\nRide my bike down the old dirt hill\nFirst time without my training wheels\nFirst time I kissed you I lost my legs\nBring that beat back to me again\n\nScream and shoutin out of innocence\nDays when all we did would never end\nBring that beat back to me again\nBring that beat back to me again\nTake me back. Can't catch me\n\nSmokin under the railroad bridge\nI used to ride my bike down that old dirt hill\nFirst time I kissed you I lost my legs\nBring that beat back to me again\n\nScream and shoutin out of innocence\nDays when all we did would never end\n\nScreamin down that old dirt hill\nBring that beat back to me again\n\nDon't you know\nDays I remember\nJust a kiss\nThat's what I miss\nJust a kiss\nThat's what I miss\nTake Me back\nTake Me back to that beat again\n\nSmokin under the railroad bridge\nBring that beat back to me again\nBring that beat back to me again\nBring that beat back to me again\nFirst time I among good friends\nBring that beat back to me again....You might also likeEmbed"
