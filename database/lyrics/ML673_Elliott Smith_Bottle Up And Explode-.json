Lyrics[Verse 1]\nBottle up and explode over and over\nKeep the troublemaker below\nPut it away and check out for the day\nIn for a round of overexposure\nThe thing mother nature provides\nTo get up and go\nBottle up and explode, seeing stars surrounding you\nRed white and blue\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou look at him like you've never known him\nBut I know for a fact that you have\nThe last time you cried\nWho'd you think was inside?\nThinking that you were about to come over\nBut I'm tired now of waiting for you\nYou never show\nBottle up and go, if you're gonna hide, it's up to you\nI'm coming through\n[Outro]\nBottle up and go\nI can make it outside\nI'll get through\nBecoming you\nBecoming you\nBecoming youYou might also like1Embed"
