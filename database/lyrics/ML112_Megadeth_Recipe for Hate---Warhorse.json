Warhorse LyricsPart I: Recipe for Hate\n\n[Verse 1]\nEach day, my shortcomings pick my pockets\nMy faults were letters carved in stone\nAs meaningful to you as words written in water\nI'm left to walk this world alone\nIn a broken mold they made me\nThe black sheep of the family\nWorth less than zero\nMy opinion and room temperature IQ\nI did something, now I'm nothing\nAlways wrong with this or that\nPoisoned with fear\nWatch it twist my measly brain mad\n[Verse 2]\nTalk about me when my back is turned\nNext time we meet, it will be too late\nThe memory burnt in my ears of what you said\nAnd now I've got a recipe for hate, taste it\nDark clouds on the horizon make it hard to breathe\nA walking mistake\nBut every time I run away\nI just come back for more\nThe choice is clear\nI can quit and fall on my sword\nOr light a fire to see who runs or stays\nAnd plays the confidence game\n\nPart II: Warhorse\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm feeling quite invisible\nI feel just like thin air\nThe truth taunts me\nThat nobody wants me\nI see the Earth below me\nI watch it spin there\nDoes someone somewhere out there hear me?\nSentenced to walk in purgatory\nMy life is running down\nI can't believe what they've done to me\nI'm left riding a warhorse\nA man without a countryYou might also likeEmbed"
