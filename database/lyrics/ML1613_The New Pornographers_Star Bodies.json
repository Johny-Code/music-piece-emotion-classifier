Bring your hands\nYes and no, there's no right, but we have no better light\nTo see through to our star bodies go\n\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nThere's a shake with the shock and a gift off with them\nThey carry the dust of the failing wisdom\n\n[Chorus]\nFor you, there's not any warning\nFor you, there's not any warning\nAnd love is five in the morning\nFor you, there's not any warning\n\n[Bridge]\nNow, take me to where your sister lives\nTake me to where your sister lives\nTake me to where your sister lives\nTake me to where your sister lives\n\n[Verse 3]\nOn a tear, far from home by a thread\nAnna Lee, what's been said has to stay between us\nCall me over, I trust we lay here\n'Til we must make our break to our star bodies go\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus 1]\nThere's a shake with the shock and a gift off with them\nThey carry the dust of the failing wisdom\n\n[Chorus]\nFor you, there's not any warning\nFor you, there's not any warning\nAnd love is five in the morning\nFor you, there's not any warning\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\n'Til we skip through the towns to the bright, sweet, passed on\nAnd bury the dust of the failing wisdom\n\n[Chorus]\nFor you, there's not any warning\nFor you, there's not any warning\nAnd love is five in the morning\nFor you, there's not any warning\n\n[Outro]\nNow, take me to where your sister lives\nTake me to where your sister livesEmbed"
