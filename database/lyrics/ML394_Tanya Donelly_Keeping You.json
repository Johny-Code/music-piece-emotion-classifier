Donelly)\n\nI'm keeping you I'm keeping you\nI'm keeping you so realize your fate\nI'm keeping you I'm keeping you\nI'm keeping you so settle down now\n\nYou landed here from inner space\nYou landed with that screwed-up look on your face\nI wanted you from way back when\nI wanted you for years, then years again\nI'm keeping you I'm keeping you\nI'm keeping you so settle in now\n\nMy return to wildlife by satellite\nBy beautiful moon-shining girl\nWhether by hard ground or splashdown\nWe're safely back in the world\n\nMy heart's not new\nI'm not like you\nI've loved and been loved well and badly too\nMy body's been through everything\nI've used and been used\nI got over it\nThere's something that you learn on a tightrope\nJust outside the spotlight there's a big net waiting for...\n\nMy return to wildlife by satellite\nBy beautiful moon-shining girl\nWhether by hard ground or splashdown\nWe're safely back in the world\n\nI'm keeping youYou might also likeEmbed"
