Oh yeah\n\nLove is a mystery I can't demystify, oh no\nSometimes I wonder why we're here\nBut I don't care, I don't care\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen I hear the drummer, get me in a groove\nWhen I hear the guitar, make me wanna move\nCan you feel the magic floating in the air?\nCan you feel the magic? Oh yeah\nSometimes you're feeling you been pushed around\nAnd your rainbow just ain't here\nDon't you fear, don't you fear\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhen you hear the music, trouble disappear\nWhen you hear the music ringing in your ears\nCan you feel the magic floating in the air?\nCan you feel the magic? Oh yeah, yeah\n\n[Verse 4]\nCan you hear the music?\nCan you hear the music?\nCan you feel the magic dancing in the air?\nCan you feel the magic? Oh yeah\n\nLove is a mystery, can't be mystified, oh no\nSometime I'm dancing on air\nAnd I get scared, I get scared\n\n[Outro]\nWhen you hear the music ringing in my ears\nCan you hear the music? Oh yeah\nCan you hear the drummer get you in a groove?\nCan you hear the guitar make you wanna move? Yeah\nYou might also likeCan you hear the music? Oh, yeah\nCan you hear the music ringing in my ears?\nCan you hear the music? Can you hear the music?\nCan you hear the music? Can you hear the music?\nCan you hear the music?
