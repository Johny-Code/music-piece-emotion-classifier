Gimme a funky-ass bassline!\nRight here!\n[Verse 1: Ice Cube]\nHere's a little somethin' 'bout a nigga like me\nNever should've been let out the penitentiary\nIce Cube would like to say\nThat I'm a crazy muthafucka from around the way\nSince I was a youth, I smoked weed out\nNow I'm the muthafucka that you read about\nTakin' a life or two, that's what the hell I do\nYou don't like how I'm livin'? Well, fuck you!\nThis is a gang, and I'm in it\nMy man Dre'll fuck you up in a minute\nWith a right-left, right left ya toothless\nAnd then you say \"Goddamn, they ruthless!\"\nEverywhere we go they say \"Damn!\"\nN.W.A's fuckin' up the program\nAnd then you realize we don't care\nWe don\u2019t just say no, we\u2019re too busy sayin' \"Yeah!\"\nAbout drinkin' straight out the eight bottle\nDo I look like a muthafuckin' role model?\nTo a kid lookin' up to me\nLife ain't nothin' but bitches and money\n'Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last\nIf you fuck with me, I\u2019ll put my foot in your ass\nSee, I don't give a fuck, 'cause I keep bailin'\nYo!

Boom! Boom! Yeah, I was gunnin'\nAnd then you look, all you see is niggas runnin'\nAnd fallin' and yellin' and pushin' and screamin' and cussin'\nI stepped back and I kept bustin'\nAnd then I realized it's time for me to go\nSo I stopped, jumped in the vehicle\nIt's like this, because of that who-ride\nN.W.A is wanted for a homicide\n'Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last\nFuck with me, I'll put my foot in your ass\nSee, I don't give a fuck, 'cause I keep bailin'\nYo, what the fuck are they yellin'?\n[Chorus: MC Ren + Sample]\nGangsta!
