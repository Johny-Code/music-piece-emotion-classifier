        "lyrics": "The Confidential Agent Lyrics[Verse 1]\nTake the velvet line for comfort\nHigh above the water, feel disconnected and free\nTired of hopes that I just can't run from\nI travel in secret, I know they're pursuing me\nMorning that falls represents a weak link\nAfter is after night's work is done\nThere's no sun, just a grey horizon\nHiding from heaven another frozen world\n\n[Chorus]\nWatch the ship hold to its course\nAs an act of devotion\nAnd me, I'm lost at sea\nGoing through the motions\n[Verse 2]\nGave all my passion to the ocean\nShe holds it for me in reserve\nMy word is gone into remission\nYour love's a tragedy that I don't deserve\nShe said, \"You're only growing now.\"\nShe said, \"Soon have we begun, then she can have you\nBut until then, you're mine\nUntil then, you're mine.\"\n\n[Chorus]\nI watch her hold to her course\nAs an act of devotion\nAnd me, I'm riding high\nGoing through\n\nSeems like every flash in her eye's\nAn act of devotion\nAnd me I'm lost in her hands\nGoing through the motions\n\n[Outro]\nShore far away off the port side\nShore far away off the bow\nShore far away off the starboard side\nShore far away from nowYou might also likeEmbed"
