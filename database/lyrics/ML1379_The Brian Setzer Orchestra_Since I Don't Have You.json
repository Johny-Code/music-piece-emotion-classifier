Vogel\n\nOh, I don't have plans and schemes\nAnd I don't have hopes and dreams\nBaby, I just don't have anything\nSince I don't have you\n\nI don't have fond desires\nAnd I don't have happy hours\nBaby, I just don't have anything, anything\nSince I don't have you, I don't have you\nI don't have happiness\nAnd I guess I never will ever again\nWhen you walked out on me\nIn walked old misery\nAnd he's been here since then\n\nI don't have love to share\nAnd I don't have one who cares\nBaby, I just don't have anything\nSince I don't have you, I don't have you\n\nI don't have happiness\nAnd I guess I never will ever again\nWhen you walked out on me\nIn walked old misery\nAnd he's been here since then\n\nI don't have love to share\nAnd I don't have one who cares\nBaby, I just don't have anything\nSince I don't have youYou might also likeEmbed"
