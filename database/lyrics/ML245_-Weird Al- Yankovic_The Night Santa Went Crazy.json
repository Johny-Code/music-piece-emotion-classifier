Now you're all gonna die!\"\n\n[Chorus]\nThe night Santa went crazy\nThe night Saint Nick went insane\nRealized he'd been getting a raw deal\nSomething finally must have snapped in his brain\n[Verse 2]\nWell, the workshop is gone now\u2014he decided to bomb it\nEverywhere you'll find pieces of Cupid and Comet\nAnd he tied up his helpers, and he held the elves hostage\nAnd he ground up poor Rudolph into reindeer sausage\nHe got Dancer and Prancer with an old German Luger\nAnd he slashed up Dasher just like Freddy Krueger\nAnd he picked up a flamethrower and he barbecued Blitzen\nAnd he took a big bite and said, \"It tastes just like chicken!\"\n\n[Chorus]\nThe night Santa went crazy\nThe night Kris Kringle went nuts\nNow you can hardly walk around the North Pole\nWithout stepping in reindeer guts\n\n[Bridge]\nThere's the National Guard and the FBI\nThere's a van from the Eyewitness News\nAnd helicopters circlin' 'round in the sky\nAnd the bullets are flyin', the body count's risin'\nAnd everyone's dyin' to know ... oh Santa, why?\nMy, my, my, my, my, my\nYou used to be such a jolly guy\n\n[Verse 3]\nYes, Virginia, now Santa's doing time\nIn a federal prison for his infamous crime\nHey, little friend now, don't you cry no more tears\nHe'll be out with good behavior in seven hundred more years\nBut now Vixen's in therapy, and Donner's still nervous\nAnd the elves all got jobs working for the postal service\nAnd they say Mrs. Claus, she's on the phone every night\nWith her lawyer, negotiating the movie rights\nYou might also likeThey're talkin' 'bout\n\n[Chorus]\nThe night Santa went crazy\nThe night Saint Nicholas flipped\nBroke his back for some milk and cookies\nSounds to me like he was tired of gettin' gypped\n\nWo-oh, the night Santa went crazy\nThe night Saint Nick went insane\nRealized he'd been getting a raw deal\nSomething finally must have snapped in his brain\nWo-oh, something finally must have snapped in his brain\nTell ya, something finally must have snapped... in his brainEmbed"
