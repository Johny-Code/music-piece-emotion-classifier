(No fair)\nOr did it wake you up from your sleeping?\n[Chorus]\nI've overheard it once, this has gone on before\nIt's too one in the same when you're accounted for\nWe seem so far away from these things we used to know\nWe seem so far away from everything we are\n\n[Verse 2]\nEveryone that moves around me\nThey're saying nothing\nThat makes the fight a blur\nSay we're something that no one wanted to hear\nThey know that everything is wrong\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWas it all enough? (No fair)\nOr did it wake you up from your sleeping?\n\n[Chorus]\nI've overheard it once, this has gone on before\nIt's too one in the same when you're accounted for\nWe seem so far away from these things we used to know\nWe seem so far away from everything we are\n\n[Outro]\nAll we are is golden, this won't mean a thing\nAll we are is golden, this won't mean a thingYou might also likeEmbed"
