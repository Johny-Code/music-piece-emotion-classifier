Said the commissar\nFrom there your own way home\nBut I never got to Kiev\nWe never came back home\nTrain went north to the Taiga\nWe were stripped and marched in file\nUp the great siberian road\nFor miles and miles and miles and miles\nDressed in stripes and tatters\nIn a gulag left to die\nAll because Comrade Stalin was scared that\nWe'd become too westernized!\nYou might also likeUsed to love my country\nUsed to be so young\nUsed to believe that life was\nThe best song ever sung\nI would have died for my country\nIn 1945\nBut now only one thing remains\nBut now only one thing remains\nBut now only one thing remains\nBut now only one thing remains\nThe brute will to survive!Embed"
