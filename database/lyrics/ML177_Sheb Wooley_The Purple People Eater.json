(Ooh!)\nI commenced to shakin' and I said, \"Ooh-eee!\nIt looks like a purple people eater to me!\"\n\nIt was a one-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater\n(One-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater)\nA one-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater\nSure looks strange to me (One eye?)\nWell, he came down to earth and he lit in a tree\nI said, \"Mr. Purple People Eater, don't eat me!\"\nI heard him say in a voice so gruff:\n\"I wouldn't eat you 'cause you're so tough.\"\n\nIt was a one-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater\nOne-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater\nOne-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater\nSure looks strange to me (One horn?)\n\nI said, \"Mr. Purple People Eater, what's your line?\"\nHe said, \"Eatin' purple people and it sure is fine\nBut that's not the reason that I came to land\nI wanna get a job in a rock and roll band.\"\n\nWell bless my soul, rock and roll, flyin' purple people eater\nPigeon-toed, undergrowed, flyin' purple people eater\n(We wear short shorts)\nFriendly little people eater\nWhat a sight to see! (Oooh!)\n\nAnd then he swung from the tree and he lit on the ground\nHe started to rock, really rockin' around\nIt was a crazy ditty with a swingin' tune\nSing a bop bap aboopa lappa loom bam boom\nYou might also likeWell bless my soul, rock and roll, flyin' purple people eater\nPigeon-toed, undergrowed, flyin' purple people eater\n\"I like short shorts\"\nFlyin' little people eater\nWhat a sight to see! (Purple People?)\n\nAnd then he went on his way, and then what do ya know\nI saw him last night on a TV show\nHe was blowing it out, a'really knockin' em dead\nPlayin' rock and roll music through the horn in his head\n\n[Sped-up saxophone solo]\n\"Tequila\"Embed"
