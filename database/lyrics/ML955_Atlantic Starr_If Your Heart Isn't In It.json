Hey\n[Chorus: Wayne & Barbara]\nIf your heart isn't in it\nWhy can't you tell me so?\nIf my heart wasn't in it\nI'd have gone long ago (Long ago)\nIf your heart isn't in it\nWhy keep me hanging on? (Hanging on)\nJust tell me and I'll be gone\nFrom your life\n\n[Verse 2: Wayne, Barbara, Both]\nYou treat me like a stranger\nAs if I wasn't there\nAh baby, I waited for a miracle\nTo make you show that you care\nHey, yeah\n\n[Chorus: Wayne & Barbara]\nIf your heart isn't in it\nWhy can't you tell me so?\nIf my heart wasn't in it\nI'd have gone long ago (Long ago)\nIf your heart isn't in it\nWhy keep me hanging on? (Hanging on)\nJust tell me and I'll be gone\nFrom your life\nYou might also like[Outro: Wayne & Barbara, Barbara]\nIf your heart isn't in it\nWhy can't you tell me so?\n(Why can't you tell me so?)\nI can't go through the motions\nI have to know (Have to know)\nIf your heart isn't in it\nWhy can't you tell me so?\n(Why can't you tell me so?)\nI can't go to the limit\nI have to know (Have to know)\nIf your heart...\nOoh, can't you tell me so?\nI have to know (Have to know)\nIf your heart isn't it\nWhy keep me hanging on? (Hanging on)\nJust tell me and I'll be gone (I'll be gone)\nDon't keep me hanging on\nFor dear lifeEmbed"
