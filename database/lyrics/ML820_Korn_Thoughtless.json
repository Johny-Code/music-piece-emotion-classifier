What the fuck you think it's doing to me?\nYou take your turn lashing out at me\nI want you crying with your dirty ass in front of me\n[Chorus]\nAll of my hate cannot be bound\nI will not be drowned\nBy your thoughtless scheming\nSo you can try to tear me down\nBeat me to the ground\nI will see you screaming\n\n[Verse 2]\nThumbing through the pages of my fantasies\nI'm above you, smiling at you, drown, drown, drown\nI wanna kill and rape you the way you raped me\nAnd I'll pull the trigger and you're down, down, down\n\nWhy are you trying to make fun of me?\nYou think it\u2019s funny? What the fuck you think it\u2019s doing to me?\nYou take your turn lashing out at me\nI want you crying with your dirty ass in front of me\n\n[Chorus]\nAll of my hate cannot be bound\nI will not be drowned\nBy your thoughtless scheming\nSo you can try to tear me down\nBeat me to the ground\nI will see you screaming\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nAll my friends are gone, they died\nGonna take you down\nThey all screamed and cried\nGonna take you down\n\nI've got my body, got my body back against the wall\nI've got my body, got my body back against the wall\nGonna take you down\nI've got my body, got my body back against the wall\nI've got my body, got my body back against the wall\nGonna take you down\n\nI've got my body, got my body back against the wall\nI've got my body, got my body back against the wall\nGonna take you down\nI've got my body, got my body back against the wall\nI've got my body, got my body back against the wall\n\n[Chorus]\nAll of my hate cannot be bound\nI will not be drowned\nBy your thoughtless scheming\nSo you can try to tear me down\nBeat me to the ground\nI will see you screaming\nAll of my hate cannot be bound\nI will not be drowned\nBy your thoughtless scheming\nSo you can try to tear me down\nBeat me to the ground\nI will see you screaming4Embed"
