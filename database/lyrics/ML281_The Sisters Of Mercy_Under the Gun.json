No wonder\nIt all comes back again\n\nAre you living for love?\nAre you living for love?\nI've been under the gun\nI've lost and I've ...\n\n(one, two, three, four ...)\nForget the many steps to heaven\nIt never happened and it ain't so hard\nHappiness is a loaded weapon and a\nShort cut is better by far\nExplosive bolts, ten thousand volts\nAt a million miles an hour\nAbrasive wheels and molten metals\nIt's a semi-automatic, get in the car\nCorrosive heart and frozen heat\nWe're worlds apart where we could meet\nWhere the street fold round and the motors start\nAnd the idiot wields the power\nWhere the chosen hold the highest card\nOn the field of honour where the ground is hard\nSo the highest hand is joking wild\nAnd the house soon fold and no-one stand\nI put my finger on and dialled\nThe tower, the moon, the gun, and\nNine nine nine, singer down\nCloudburst and all around\nThe first are last, the blessed get wired\nThe best is yet to come\nI put my finger on and fired\nHeat-seeking, out of the sun\nYou can set the controls for the heart or the knees\nAnd the meek'll inherit what they damn well please\nGet ahead, go figure, go ahead and pull the trigger\nEverything under the gunYou might also likeEmbed"
