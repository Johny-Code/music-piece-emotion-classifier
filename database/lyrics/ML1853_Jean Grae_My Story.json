        "lyrics": "My Story Lyrics[Verse 1: Jean Grae]\n\u201cIf I could swim a thousand lakes to bring your life back...\u201d  I write\nThat, but infinity can\u2019t rewind facts.  You are\nDivinity.  My primitive mind was struggling\nJust to understand the meaning of life, forgive me\nI never told my mommy, I couldn\u2019t break her spirit.  She always\nWished her daughter extraordinary thinking, so I\nTraveled alone, young, sixteen, got in\nThe habit of not staying at home, doing the\nSad walk like Bill Bixby, a dollar fifty\nTrips to the hospital so that Medicaid could fix me\nI couldn\u2019t eat shit.  I fainted frequent\nOn cold floors and I pause and I think, \u201cKeep it\u201d\nI\u2019m lost.  My four friends know and just\nFuck at the boys\u2019 apartments for rent, so I\u2019m all\nWishing that it\u2019s a dream ending soon.  I\u2019ve actually\nErased a lot that I\u2019ve been through\n[Hook: Jean Grae]\nSee, when\nThe rain comes down\nI know it\u2019s falling for me\nAnd only for me\nAnd when\nThe pain comes around, there\u2019s nowhere\nElse I rather would be\nI know what I\u2019ve done (Please forgive me)\n\n[Verse 2: Jean Grae]\nNow all my bitter homies saying, \u201cThat\u2019s what men do.\u201d  Feeling\nRetarded for seeing partner potential.  On top\nOf that, the doctors telling me a heart murmur.  I can\u2019t\nTake it, I\u2019m contemplating a Glock burner, a\nCop murderer.  I can\u2019t leave.  This can\u2019t be\nThe tears streaming, and I can\u2019t see they lanced me\nAnd I\u2019m passing out, and this is just for blood.  They had\nTo cover the mass amounts.  I\u2019ve had enough\nAnd you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like in waiting rooms, and out-\n-side, their picketing pictures could slay you\nThey\u2019re screaming, \u201cVictims,\u201d and spitting \u2018til they shame you\nI hold my head low and shiver, push my way through\nThey put you in a room where you can change into\nYour gown and shower cap, shaking as a fiend would do\nAnd that\u2019s when you think of leaving, fleeing the building\nAnd then they call you and you\u2019re hearing the call of your children\nThey count down from ten now.  You wanna stop \u2018em, but\nYou say it in your head: you\u2019re out for the cut\nAnd then you wake up in another room with plenty others\nThey call it recovery.  You\u2019re thinking, \u201cWe ain\u2019t mothers\u201d\nAnd then prescription pills, written a \u2018script with chills\nAn understatement.  You\u2019re dressed but you\u2019re naked still\nAnd your brain won\u2019t think straight\nWait.  Can\u2019t finish this\nYou might also like[Hook: Jean Grae]\nSee, when\nThe rain comes down\nI know it\u2019s falling for me\nAnd only for me\nAnd when\nThe pain comes around, there\u2019s nowhere\nElse I rather would be\nI know what I\u2019ve done (Please forgive me)\n\n[Verse 3: Jean Grae]\nI kept it bottled up.  My parents found the pills\nScreaming, \u201cGod what have you done?\u201d  Cried \u2018til I snotted blood\nThen got a gun.  My temple ran quick though\nFrom the thought, then the worst: I was caught in the same place\nA year later.  For me, that\u2019s when hatred started\nMy faith martyred.  I\u2019ve dated the father of a father\nThen I moved on.  Years passed, the guilt\u2019s\nWorse and it builds \u2018til your heart\u2019s smashed\nThen I miscarried.  Twenty-two age, I was headed to\nA breakdown, swallowed up some pills and I laid down\nI was a failure at that too, bailed from\nThe rap then, but fate took me back in\n\u201cSing\u201d is a tattoo my fingers attached with.  Twenty-seven\nWith three kids that I never met.  What if I\nWas Catholic?  Wonder if they hate me, thinking how\nTheir mother could ever murder?  Well take me, Hell\nTo the depths where the brimstone chokes me constantly\nI am a monster, see.  How could I possibly\nCorrespond with God when I gave the authority\nTo end their life?\nBut it\u2019s never over, even if we have a child\nThey could have had a brother or a sister or both\nI\u2019m thinking about another life that almost got close\nPraying that, in another time, we could have changed posts\nIf I could just reverse time, I would\nI don\u2019t know what I would do.  Honestly, it\u2019s not good\nI\u2019m sorry...4Embed"
