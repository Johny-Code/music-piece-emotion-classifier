        "lyrics": "Broken Butterflies Lyrics[Verse 1]\nYou wear your anger well and stand\nFor all the world to see\nA heavy cloak and one gloved hand\nAnd no humility\nYou stand inside the garden\nAnd feast on black cherries\nAnd swallow the manna from heaven\nAnd spit out the seeds\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou spread your anger on sharp-edged knives\nCut my skin and make it bleed\nLike Pilate in his self-righteousness\nYou're a traitor and a thief\nChoking on your unplanned words\nCoughing up your lies\nTumbling from your mouth a flurry\nOf broken butterflies\n[Verse 3]\nBroken butterflies at rest\nTheir wings have snapped in two\nOn their way to certain death\nTheir colors golden blue\nBut the blood that flows I cannot hide\nThe blood that covers me\nNourishes the butterflies\nAnd they are healed and are set free\n\n[Verse 4]\nI wish you had what Ruth possessed\nBut then I don't expect that of you\nGrace and honor and faithfulness\nAnd the love that you refuse\nWill you ever learn to just forgive?\nWill you open your beautiful eyes\nAnd bleed the way Christ did\nAnd fix the broken butterflies?You might also likeEmbed"
