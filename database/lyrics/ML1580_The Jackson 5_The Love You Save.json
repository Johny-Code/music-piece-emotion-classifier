You'd better save it\nStop, stop, stop, you'd better save it\n\n[Verse 1]\nWhen we played tag in grade school\nYou wanted to be It\nBut chasing boys was just a fad\nYou crossed your heart you'd quit\n\nWhen we grew up you traded\nYour promise for my ring\nNow just like back to grade school\nYou're doing the same old thing\n[Chorus]\nStop! The love you save may be your own\nDarling, take it slow\nOr someday you'll be all alone\nYou'd better stop! The love you save may be your own\nDarling, look both ways before you cross me\nYou're headed for a danger zone\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nI'm the one who loves you\nI'm the one you need\nThose other guys will put you down\nAs soon as they succeed\nThey'll ruin your reputation\nThey'll label you a flirt\nThe way they talk about you\nThey'll turn your name to dirt, oh\n\n[Verse 2]\nIsaac said he kissed you\nBeneath the apple tree\nWhen Benji held your hand he felt\nElectricity\n\nWhen Alexander called you\nHe said he rang your chime\nChristopher discovered\nYou're way ahead of your time\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nStop! The love you save may be your own\nDarling, take it slow\nOr someday you'll be all alone\nYou'd better stop! The love you save may be your own\nDarling, look both ways before you cross me\nYou're headed for a danger zone\n\n[Bridge]\nSlow down\nSlow down\nSlow down\nSlow down\n\nS is for \"Save it\"\nT is for \"Take it slow\"\nO is for \"Oh, no!\"\nP is for \"Please, please, don't go!\"\n\n[Outro]\nThe love you save may be your own\nSome day you may be all alone\nStop it\nSave it, girl\nBaby! Ooh\nYou'd better stop! The love you save may be your own\nPlease, please\nOr someday, someday baby, you'll be all alone\n\nI'm the one who loves you\nI'm the one you need\nThose other guys will put you down as soon as they succeed\n\nStop! The love you save may be your own, baby\nYou'd better stop it, stop it, stop it girl\nOr someday you'll be all alone\n\nThe way they talk about you\nThey'll turn your name, turn your name to dirt\nStop! The love you save may be your own!\nDon't 'cha know don't 'cha know\nSome day baby you'll be all alone\n\nWait a while\nThose other guys will put you down as soon as they succeed7Embed"
