How low can you go?\nDeath row? What a brother know\nOnce again, back is the incredible rhyme animal\nThe uncannable D, Public Enemy Number One\nFive-O said, \"Freeze!\"\u2014and I got numb\nCan I tell 'em that I really never had a gun?\nBut it's the wax that the Terminator X spun\nNow they got me in a cell 'cause my records, they sell\n'Cause a brother like me said, \"Well\nFarrakhan's a prophet, and I think you ought to listen to\nWhat he can say to you, what you ought to do is follow for now\"\nPower of the people say\n\"Make a miracle, D, pump the lyrical\"\nBlack is back, all in, we're gonna win\nCheck it out (Yeah, y'all, come on) here we go again\n[Hook]\nTurn it up! Bring the noise!\n\n[Bridge: Flavor Flav]\nAyo, Chuck, they're saying we're too black, man\nYo, I don't understand what they're saying\nBut little do they know they can get a smack for that, man\n[Verse 2]\nNever badder than bad 'cause the brother is madder than mad\nAt the fact that's corrupt like a senator\nSoul on a roll, but you treat it like soap on a rope\n'Cause the beats and the lines are so dope\nListen for lessons I'm saying inside music that the critics are all blasting me for\nThey'll never care for the brothers and sisters now, 'cause the country has us up for the war\nWe got to demonstrate, come on now\nThey're gonna have to wait till we get it right\nRadio stations, I question their blackness\nThey call themselves black, but we'll see if they'll play this\n\n[Hook]\nTurn it up! Bring the noise!\n\n[Bridge: Flavor Flav]\nAyo, Chuck, they illin', we chillin'\nYo, P.E. in the house, top billin'\nYo, Chuck, show 'em what you can do, boy\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nGet from in front of me, the crowd runs to me\nMy DJ is warm, he's X, I call him Norm, ya know\nHe can cut a record from side to side\nSo what, the ride, the glide should be much safer than a suicide\nSoul control, beat is the father of your rock'n'roll\nMusic for whatcha, for whichin', you call a band, man\nMaking a music, abuse it, but you can't do it, ya know\nYou call 'em demos, (but we ride limos, too)\nWhatcha gonna do? Rap is not afraid of you\nBeat is for Sonny Bono, (Beat is for Yoko Ono)\nRun-DMC first said a DJ could be a band\nStand on its own feet, get you out your seat\nBeat is for Eric B. and LL as well, hell\nWax is for Anthrax, still it can rock bells\nEver forever, universal, it will sell\nTime for me to exit, Terminator X-it\n\n[Hook]\nTurn it up! Bring the noise!\n\n[Bridge: Flavor Flav]\nYo, they should know by now that they can't stop this bum rush\nWord up, better keep tellin' me to turn it down\nBut yo, Flavor Flav ain't going out like that\n[Chuck D]\nCome on!\nCome on!\nCome on now!\nCome on!\n\n[Verse 4]\nFrom coast to coast, so you stop being like a comatose\n\"Stand, my man? The beat's the same with a boast toast\"\nRock with some pizzazz, it will last. Why you ask?\nRoll with the rock stars, still never get accepted as\nWe got to plead the Fifth, you can investigate\nDon't need to wait, get the record straight\nHey, posse in effect, got Flavor, Terminator\nX to sign checks, play to get paid\nWe got to check it out down on the avenue\nA magazine or two is dissing me and dissing you\nYeah, I'm telling you\n\n[Outro: Flavor Flav]\nHey yo, Griff, get thirty S1W, we got to handle this\nWe ain't goin' out like that\nYo, man, straight up on the Columbo tip\nWe can do this, like Brutus\n'Cause we always knew this\nYou know what I'm sayin'\nThere's just one thing that puzzles me, my brother\nWhat's wrong with all these people around here, man?\nIs they clocking? Is they rocking? Is they shocking?...5Embed"
