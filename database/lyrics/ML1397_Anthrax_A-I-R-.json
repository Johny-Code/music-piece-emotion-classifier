Lyrics[Verse 1]\nYoung and free, something you'll never be\nA childhood's end, it's lunacy\nPure dictation, they don't listen\nAnd you're just waiting for what you're missing\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWelcome to your nightmare\nYou just can't walk away\nIt's time for you to choose your fate\nYou just can't let it lay\nWelcome to our nightmare\nYour whole life's on the way, today\n[Chorus]\nYou're no good, misunderstood\nA.I.R\nAll their hopes and visions\nOf what they want you to be\nCrucial times, made up minds\nA.I.R\nSo high and mighty\nThough much too blind to see\n\n[Verse 2]\nWho are you gonna live your life for?\nConformity will trap you like a locked door\nIndependence means owning your decisions\nAuthority will put your soul in prison\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWelcome to your nightmare\nYou just can't walk away\nIt's time for you to choose your fate\nYou just can't let it lay\nWelcome to your nightmare\nYour whole life's on the way, today\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're no good, misunderstood\nA.I.R\nAll their hopes and visions\nOf what they want you to be\nCrucial times, made up minds\nA.I.R\nSo high and mighty\nThough much too blind to see\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nFight or go insane, there's no-one else to blame\nStop their influence, you can't give them a chance\nBreak right through the wall that separates us all\nStart your second life without their hands in sight\n\n[Guitar Solo]\nOh!\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou got your pride\nYou got your visions\nDon't subside, don't ever give in, no\nDon't compromise, just keep on grinning\nThe games they play\nYou just keep on winning\n\n[Outro]\nKeep on winning, keep on winning\nKeep on winning\nA.I.REmbed"
