        "lyrics": "Ripples in the Mesh - The Radioplay Lyrics[Documentary style commentator]\n\nThey have visited us from the dawn of time. And one can always read the signs. Their rebirth into our world is always coursed with famine, plague and death. Their latest manifestation, which seems to have been the most powerful, happened in the midst of 20th century depression in Central America. A child suffers from terrible nightmares. Nightmares that was so fiercely overwhelming that they became, aware of themselves.\n\nAnd they could even experience our realm through a lucid state. They learn to manifest themselves.  And they studied, and watched, and schemed. Then grew and grew stronger and grew greater till they finally announced their arrival to the world AS! ...\n\n\u2026A highly successful multi-billionaire dollar soda pop industry.\n\nAnd their overwhelming success was so magnificent, so unnervingly final, that they soon heaved more power and capital than any country worth mentioning. And they were eccentric, and they would paint the clouds and grow strange things and even scoop proud cities from the Earth, made to float and follow the golden sun!\n\nThe Constructus Corporation presents: the Ziggurat.\n[Narrator]\n\nThe Ziggurat, a giant floating megalopolis of comfortable living, housed four autonomous societies and over a billion people. It was filled with more exciting personalities than a pomegranate is of pips! But for now, consider these two boys:\n\nFirst: Randomboy -- A tight young MC and a natural leader, who in time would change the world for ever.\n\nAnd secondly: his best friend, the Kidtronic.\n\nNow, when studying Kidtronic it is vitally important to consider the following: him and his sister were orphans, and were raised by virtual parent personalities supplied by Constructus. Uhm, now. At the age of seven, he had re-written their program instructions and changed the parental shapes from loving moms and dads into two big fluffy bears that generally just acted silly and entertained his baby sister Anica.\n\nAt the age of 8 and a half, he was arrested by the Constructus assistants for the first time. His crime? He had hi-jacked two sprinter wet-wires servers and was using them to embezzle third-decimal credit to his sister's favorite virtual celebrities. It was the first in a series of five arrests.\n\nNow, as you'd probably noticed, he was a complete genius\nwith all the tech- and cyber-reality. Kidtronic also designed games for devices called \"playgrounds,\" which covered your eyes and ears.\n\nHe was also paid annual tributes by all the banks in the Ziggurat for not bankrupting them.\n\nNow c\u2019mon! Let's see what he's up too. Oh! He's sleeping. Dreaming. Changing, into what he will soon become.\n\n\n[Kidtronic dream]\n\nZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZz\n\nWait were am I? Breakfast table. Before school. A Mom and a dad. Anica. She's feeding us eggs. I don't wanna eat eggs. My dad's on the table. ARGH! He's cutting my hand. ARGHGHGG! My Brain! Uh uh uh uh uh!\n[Narrator]\n\nAlmost at that precise moment, thirteen years before, in a secret hide-away 3 kilometers under the Himalayas, the CEO of Constructus International, a certain Mr. Kiriaku was in a meeting with the eyeless, prophet-witch named \"Next\"\n\n[Next in \u201c\u201d and Mr. Kiriaku in ( )]\n\n\u201cAhhhhhhhhh\u201d\n(Tell me what you see?)\n\u201cAh hahhafghghghha ! Lord. There will be danger ahg \u2026\u201d\n(Danger ?)\n\u201cEhh\u201d\n(What? What is its source?)\n\u201cToo much static uirghghg. Disturbance.\u201d\n(Speak, Next. What is the threat?)\n\u201cLord it is fast. Thirteen years from this moment.\u201d\n(Thirteen years...Thirteen years!? What is its face? Where will it come from?)\n\u201cLord, it seems to be invisible. All I can make out is... ripples. Ripples in the Mesh.\u201d\n(Well then find it Next!)\n\u201cI cannot, the pattern that the chaos weaves is too frantic, too - rand- AURGH\u201d\n\n\u201cOne will rise that will earn friends\u2026 The [?] time [?], and your blood [?]\u201d\n\n(Prophet enough! An invisible threat. Thirteen years from now. Capable of wiping Constructus off the face of the Earth? A mere random ripple in The Mesh that threatens me, a god! What created light, our light that cripples radiance! To be snuffed by a mere, random ripple in The Mesh?\nThen I will create our champion. Hahaha. Our own hideous weapon. And send him up to dwell amongst the humans and seek and destroy the ripple-maker)\n\n[Narrator]\nAnd that very same day, two children were born on two different places on the Ziggurat. One, to loving family; and other to a multi-national corporation. But right now back to our story\n\nKidtronic had woken up and was loading his new game \"Long Street\" onto his playground. He wanted to show it to his friend Randomboy. He was hoping that they might get a chance to play it on the way to the emceeing competition. He was feeling a little nervous because him and Randomboy had both entered the competition. It was very prestigious, and the biggest of its kind yet. At the moment, he was concentrating on the show, doing some breathing exercises when his sister entered the room, without warning.\n\n[Anica and Kidtronic]\n\n\u201cBOO!\n\n\u201cARGH. Oh jeez, you scared the bejebus out of me. Don't do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, where you going huh 'Tronic?\u201d\n\n\u201cNowhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes you are! You're going to that emceeing competition aren't you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo I'm not.\u201d\n\n\u201cOhoh ! Please can I come with you, PLEeeeeease!?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo Anica, you're too young.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm not! Please, I won't bug you I swear, I sweaaaaar!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u201d\n\n\u201cI promise, I won't even stand close to you guys\u201d\n\n\u201cAnica stop, I said no and that's final. I'm leaving \u2013 Bye-bye\u201d\n\n\u201cOh he's such a stupid punk. I hate him! He never takes me, anywhere! But I love you Mr. Rockadopolis\u201d\n\n[Anica and Mr. Rockadopolis]\n\n\u201cUhm, yeah. I love you too Anica. I whip that kid's ass.\u201d\n\n\"No! You mustn't Mr Rockadopolis. They shouldn't know that you're real. I hate him. Did you know that he suffers from epilepileptic... ehhhpelepileptic ... E-E-EPILEPILEPTIC seizures?! No, you wouldn't. Only me and Randomboy knows that. He doesn't want anybody to know. When they happen, he makes himself disappear. And I especially hate it when he disappears. Ah, forget him! I`m going.\"\n\n[Narrator]\n\nOn the way to Randomboy house\u2026\n\n[In Kidtronic\u2019s mind]\n\n\"He suffers from seizures\" [repeats many times,]\n\u201cI am inside of you\u201d\n\u201cJeez, what was that?\u201d\n\u201cI feel fine\u201d\n\u201cWhat is he becoming?\u201d\n\n[Narrator]\nRandomboy opened his front door, and there stood Kidtronic, ridiculously punctual as usual.\n\n[Kidtronic, Randomboy, Anica, Narrator]\n\n\u201cYo, Randomboy,\u201d said Kidtronic through his electronic telepathic interface.\n\n\u201cYo\u201d\n\n\u201cCheck this out,\u201d he continued, whilst downloading a game into Randomboy's playground. \u201cI made this last night. It's called \u2018Long Street\u2019. I am the Ju-Ju man. You are Snufflegruff, which I still think is whack. You should make up your own-\u201c\n\n\u201cHey man, interrupted Random Boy, we've been through this already.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, well anyway, You must try and defeat me. Biter.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoo!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon't do that Anica!\u201d\n\n\u201cYo, Randomboy! What\u2019s up? Hey!\u201d\n\n\u201cHey \u2018sup Anica!\u201d\n\n\u201cGo home.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! I come with.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, go home. Go play with your dolls.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't play with dolls!\u201d\n\n\u201cThen what is this. Hahahah.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr Rockadopolis is not a doll! HE'S A MONSTER!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon't be so mean. Give the doll back to her.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey look, Anica. we're gonna be performing so you can't hang with us. An\u2019 there's gonna be too many people so, you can't go by yourself. But I know my grandma and some friends are going so...I mean, you can go with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can look after myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo you can't.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey're old! And I want to hang with you guys.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! No buts. We\u2019re leaving. I'll see you later , Nics.\u201d\n\n[Anica raps]\n\n\u201cThose these guys think that I'm just some stupid little girl. I mean, Kidtronic wouldn't even let me play with the new game he made last night. Bong street or something. And now he won't even let me to come with! It's not fair! I take those punk dicks out any day at MC-ing\nYeah, watch me flipititititit...\u201d\n\nSome of the characters in my dreams have nightmares\nWho took it upon themselves to trick me\nInto believing they were real\nNow I'm taking them out, one by one\nGorse monster play with prey just for fun, here we come!\nThree strange meta-morphing hoodoos\n'bout to rearrange, the realm of the nunus\nEverybody dudus, undo the voodoo\nLike Cookoo heh boo boo, good morning\nYou can\u2019t fuck with the frequency\nIt\u2019s squeaky clean, dream of me\nCreeping sneakily through your dream machine\nAnica the snuffling,\nchuckling, bubbling, snuggling, tugging, bugging ... unplugging,\nUgly fluffy-toy duckling, hugging sucklings\n\nI move in and out of bodies freely\nNobody can see me\nCreepy-crawly heebie-jeebie\nGetting all touchy-feely\nLa la la la la\u2026\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is that? Something strange is going on? Get away.\u201d\n\u201cI don't want you going in the woods again, yeah, I'm warning you.\u201d\n\nThe people of Long Street lived very simple lives\nThey had wonderful natures, they were never impolite\nUp until the day the Ju-ju man, came to town\nnow check it out, as I break-it-down.\nMrs. Lekkerlegs. Was busy hanging her washing on the line\nSo, what happened next was definitively like the last thing on her mind\nAn unfamiliar voice behind her said: \"How do you do?\"\nErhm \"I'm very well thanks\" she replied \"but now, who are you?\"\nThe strange character in a top hat and a long black coat\nIntroduced himself politely, and then said \"on that note I'd like to show you another something that I doubt you've ever seen\nTake a look at this, beautiful machine\nThe strange little gadget started changing like magic\nAnd cleverly made its way up to the clothes line\nAnd in a blink of eye it removed the clothes, and span them around 'til they were dry\nAnd they all folded very neatly, in no time\nEummh some Mrs. Lekkerlegs was quite taken back\nVery curious about this mysterious character in black\nVery soon the whole town was making the scene\nAbout the Ju-ju man and his amazing machine\nSomething very, extra ordinary, is going to happen at the Long Street carnival\nDon't wanna tell you \u201cwhat gives you that impression, he's crazy\u201d\nSomething very, extra-ordinary is going to happen at the Long Street carnival\n\u201cWh-what you talkin' about?\u201d\n\nThe next day the Ju-ju man went walking through town\nUnaware of what everybody was talking about\nHe had some time to kill before his appointment a little later with the mayor.\nSo he took this opportunity to socialize a bit\nAnd just between you and me the most surprising shit\nIt's about that spark, that strangest things have a habit of coming out the dark\nBut just when you expect them least umumu\nLies never rest in peace, anyway\nToday was kind like, quite an important day\nOh everybody has come to see the Ju-ju man special present for the mayor\nHe greeted crowd with a bow that open, his big fat sack. And that tack.\nPresented the mayor with a black backpack.\nEverybody standing round went oohhh !\nMayor put it on, and I was like \"ummhh. What does it do?\"\nAll of a sudden two long white arms with red button at the end, Extended at the end of the back-pack\nGrab a \u2018hold of them my friend.\nThe mayor follow this instruction and felt the power surge\nAs the special metal wings emerged\nAnd everybody cried out with glee as The mayor took off clumsily, like a bumblebee\nSomething very, extra-ordinary is going to happen at the Long Street carnival\n\u201cWh-what you talkin' about?\u201d\n\u201cKeep an eye about that [?]\u201d\n\u201cYou know whatever, I'm trying to do my work.

Have some consideration.\u201d\n\nNow meanwhile in the woods\n\nNow Snufflegruff called an important meeting with a boom-band\nSomething's fun is going on, we better do something about it soon man\nThere's a humongous metal fungus spreading\nand everyone's acting weird\nI'm just trying to think of all this\nWe're the only ones who can see it\nWe've gotta do something to get everyone\u2019s attention\nand Hit them with our supernatural frequencies selections\nWe can build thing in the back of my Grandpa's Donkey-Kong.\nAnd take a nice cruise through town with a fat beats bumping hard\nBut we can call it, ummh, oi, the Long Street carnival\nCause I know that Ju-ju man is definitely up to, something horrible\nOk, we got, quite a lot of stuff to do so, c'mon let\u2019s get busy\nThe big fish is about to get taken out by some crazy little fishes\n\n\u201cGet ready, let's do this\u201d\nThe big day arrived as advertised and everybody goes with the festive vibe\nIf the sun rose, the best the sky was shining extra bright.\nSnuffing [?] his mind mesmerized these humans with his magnificent vibrations\nEven some visitors from afar were like \"man, isn't this amazing\"\nThe speakers bumped, as the boom-band freaked the funk\nAnd all the smiling people feeling the song\nSinging along, without a care in the world all shouting and clapping\nAll entirely unaware of what was about to happen.\nSomething very, extra-ordinary is going to happen at the Long Street carnival\n\n\u201cOh listen old man, c'mon man you\u2019re being a pain in the ass\u201d\n\u201cCan you please just, for one second\u201d\nSomething very, extra-ordinary is going to happen at the Long Street carnival\n\u201cGet out that, quick get out.

How many times am I gonna have to tell you. No play-grounding in the yellow zone\"\n\n\u201cThank goodness and assistant!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it looks like I'm gonna have to... confiscate them, so uh.. do the right thing and hand them over.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you cannot remove my friend\u2019s playground from his face!\u201d\n\n\u201cWho's gonna stop me?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell obviously not me. I mean, just look how big you are. You must work out? Isn't that right Kidtronic?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh Randomboy, I don't feel well\u201d\n\n\u201cYou cannot remove my friends playground face. You see, there was a random chi surge a while ago while we were playing a game and it seriously messed up Kidtronics power wire. I mean, just look at him. If you remove it now, you might do some serious damage to my friends\u2019 eyes and ears. That is why I too am wearing my playground. Not just to look cool. No, but to rather let Kidtronic hack into my head, and well, soothe my sense to stop the pain. Oh man, the, ooh- the unbearable pain. Isn't that right, Kidtronic?\u201d\n\n\u201cAck- it's a seizure\u201d\n\n\u201cNo man, just look we really have to go now. You see, it\u2019s to go see uh..\u201d\n\n\u201cSnufflegr-\u201c\n\n\u201cYes! Dr. Snufflegruff.

We're going now.\u201d\n\n[Narrator]\n\nAnd off they went\u2026\n\n[Random Boy, Kidtronic]\n\nOh, phew. That was close. Good acting Kidtronic. Man- hey, yo, you can stop acting like that now, yo he's gone. Yo 'tronic, what the hell is going on? Do you hear me or something?\u201d\n\n\u201cGet away from me\u2026 Random Boy!

Random- random ripples in the mesh.\u201d\n\n\u201cWha..Why?\u201d\n\n\u201cCome closer Snufflegruff. Random Boy, get back.\nStay Random Boy. My name is Kai.\u201d\n\n\u201cKai, hmm.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have lay dormant in the mind of Kidtronic for 13 years. He is a mere vessel.\u201d\n\n\u201cHmm.. oh\u201d\n\u201cAnd he has fulfilled his task beautifully, to seek out the ripple maker.\nTo find him, attach himself to me who weaves the random chaos pattern\nthat could undo all that Constructus had done. And this final threat, this natural abomination, this ripple in the mesh...is you Random Boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, far out.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee? We are the same. We were destined to collide. My very purpose was to meet you. For you see, random boy, you are life, and I am death, and this, is our beautiful union!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds like a cool game. What's it called?\u201d\n\n\u201cDie Random Boy! Die!\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019Die. Random Boy. Die?\u2019 Isn't that..?\u201d\n\n[Laser and sound effects]\n\n[Narrator]\n\nAnd so Random Boy's shadow gets knocked the f-*bleep* out of him.\n\n[Watkin Tudor Jones]\nCool, that's cool. And put that *bleep* in.\nAnd we should even leave in the ra\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Embed"
