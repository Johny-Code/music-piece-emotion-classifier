Lyrics[Verse 1]\nHere you come knocking on my door baby\nTell me what you got on your mind\nI guess those college boys all went home for the summertime\nAnd you\u2019re looking right, looking good, looking like a woman should\nSo why is it so hard to find\nA place to lay your pretty little head down once in a while\n\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nYou run on a little tough luck baby\nDon\u2019t you sweat it\nEverything is waiting inside for you\nYou know I got it\nCome and get it\n[Chorus]\nWho\u2019s your daddy, who\u2019s your baby?\nWho\u2019s your buddy, who\u2019s your friend?\nAnd who\u2019s the one guy that you come running to\nWhen your love life starts tumbling?\nI got the money if you got the honey\nLet\u2019s cut a deal let\u2019s make a plan\nWho\u2019s your daddy, who\u2019s your baby?\nWho\u2019s your buddy, who\u2019s your man?\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nYou might\u2019ve run on a little tough luck baby\nDon\u2019t you sweat it\nEverything is waiting inside for you\nYou know I got it\nSo come and get it\n\n[Chorus]\nWho\u2019s your daddy, who\u2019s your baby?\nWho\u2019s your buddy, who\u2019s your man?You might also likeEmbed"
