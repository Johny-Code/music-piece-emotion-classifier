Yes\nDo I think you're fat? Yes\nDo I think we'll fight? Yes\nDo you think you'll win? No\nDo I think you're stupid? Yes\nDo I think you're lame? Yes\nAm I stressing?\nYou're the one to blame\n[Chorus]\nCan't stand the way you look\nCan't stand the way you talk\nCan't stand the way you act\nCan't stand you\n\n[Verse 2]\nDo I think you're shit? Yes\nDo I think you're a fuck? Yes\nDo I think we'll fight? Yes\nDo you think you'll win? No\nDo I think you're stupid? Yes\nDo I think you're lame? Yes\nAm I stressing?\nYou're the one to blame\n\n[Bridge 1]\nI open my mouth at the wrong time\nAlways ragging on somebody\nI'm drunk all the time\nThrowing beer bottles and spitting in your face\nChecking through the purse\nOf the slut in your place\n\n[Bridge 2]\nShe'll never notice\nIf her money is gone\nPiss in her jacket\nAnd just send her along\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nCan't stand the way you look\nCan't stand the way you talk\nCan't stand the way you are\nCan't stand you\n\n[Verse 3]\nDo I think you're sick? Yes\nDo I think you're a fuck? Yes\nDo I think we'll fight? Yes\nDo you think you'll win? No\nDo I think you're stupid? Yes\nDo I think you're lame? Yes\nAm I stressing?\nYou're the one to blameEmbed"
