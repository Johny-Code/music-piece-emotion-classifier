Get up, sit up, you get lit up\nA knife in his neck made a polar bear spit up\nA 9, a Uzi is my only utensil\nInside his chest they found 10,000 pencils\nYou have the nerve to go against Chuck?\nWith fifty guns aimed at you, how the fuck you gonna duck, yo?\nWhen I'm mad, I'm ready to slay\nThe graveyards are packed but it ain't nothin' but child's play\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Bushwick Bill]\nYou'd better murder me, put me to rest\nCause if you don't I'll come out shootin' with my head in a bird's chest\nPissed off, the way I'm always soundin'\nKilled a punk in '82, and they just now found 'im\nSome say I'm crazy, some say I'm on crack\nBefore I die cut off my leg and let me die in Iraq\nA born loser, some say I'm mindless\nIf I get pissed off, you leave naked and spineless\nWorse than Charles Manson, never havin' a equal\nWent sleepwalking last night and killed 300 people\nWhen I woke up they had me chained to the floor\nWhen they told me what I did I killed 300 more, yo\nYou wanna rumble? Then go get your war hat\nI went to jail for assault with a carjack\nI might be small but my nuts are big\nThe worst thing that you could do is let me keep your fuckin' kids\nCause I'ma teach 'em how to act\nAnd if they ain't actin' right, they dyin' tonight\nSo, uh, ain't no use in you tryin' to spot 'em\nI send you a motherfuckin' note that says \"Chuckie's got em!\"Embed"
