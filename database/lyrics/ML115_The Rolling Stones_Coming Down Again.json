Coming down again\nComing down again, coming down again\nOn the ground again, coming down again\n[Verse 2]\nSlipped my tongue in someone else's pie\nTasting better every time\nShe turned green and tried to make me cry\nBeing hungry, it ain\u2019t no crime\n\n[Chorus]\nComing down again\nAll my time's been spent, coming down again\nComing down again (Sky fall down again)\nComing down again (Sky fall down again)\n(Sky fall down again)\nComing down again (Sky fall down again)\nComing down again\n\n[Saxophone Solo]\n\n[Outro]\nComing down again, coming down again\nWhere are all my friends?\n(Sky fall down again)\nComing down again (Sky fall down again)\nComing down again (Sky fall down again)\nComing down again\nComing down again\nWhere are all my friends?\nComing down again\nOn the ground againYou might also likeEmbed"
