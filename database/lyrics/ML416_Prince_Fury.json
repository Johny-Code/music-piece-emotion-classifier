A new star is born!\"\nSun to his shadow, rose to a thorn\nBut there ain't no fury like a woman scorned\n\n[Verse 2]\nY'all must have dug it, when you did your thing\nIt's like a song, everybody wanna sing\nWhen the music's over, your ears ring\nWith a voice that says, \"Queen got no King\"\nGot no King\n[Bridge]\nHe got a message saying, you tried to reach him on the phone\nHe didn't want to answer 'cause he's so afraid\nYou'd probably tell him just to leave you alone\n\n[Verse 3]\nI bet you heard he got another band\nThey're making money, they're making plans\nYou feel left out but you need to understand\nWord on the street: he's still your man\nHe's still your man\nHe's still your man, girl\n\n[Verse 4]\nLook out, here comes your rainy day\nNow you think you got a good reason to say\nEverything that's in your heart, come what may\nEven though his might get broken\n\n[Verse 5]\nWho's the guilty one when there ain't no judge or jury?\nShadow to the sun, next to the one\nHell ain't got no fury\n\n[Verse 6]\nWill the roses the dead keep sending\nRepair the heart in need of mending\nWill this song have a happy ending?\nOnly the woman knows, only she knows\nYou might also like[Verse 7]\nTwo sides to every story\nOne man's gloom, another man's glory\nSun to his shadow, rose to a thorn\nAin't no fury like a woman scorned\n\nOh no\nAin't no fury like a woman scorned\nOh no\nAin't no fury like a woman scorned\nNo fury like a woman scorned1Embed"
