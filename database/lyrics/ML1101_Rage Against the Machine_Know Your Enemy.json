The \"land of the free\"?\nWhoever told you that is your enemy\nNow something must be done\nAbout vengeance, a badge, and a gun\n'Cause I'll rip the mic, rip the stage, rip the system\nI was born to rage against 'em\nNow action must be taken\nWe don't need the key, we'll break in\n\n[Bridge: Maynard James Keenan]\nI've got no patience now\nSo sick of complacence now\nI've got no patience now\nSo sick of complacence now\nSick of, sick of, sick of, sick of you\nTime has come to pay\nYou might also like[Chorus: Zack De La Rocha]\nKnow your enemy\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Outro: Zack De La Rocha]\nCome on\nYes, I know my enemies\nThey're the teachers who taught me to fight me\nCompromise, conformity\nAssimilation, submission\nIgnorance, hypocrisy\nBrutality, the elite\nAll of which are American dreams\nAll of which are American dreams\nAll of which are American dreams\nAll of which are American dreams\nAll of which are American dreams\nAll of which are American dreams\nAll of which are American dreams\nAll of which are American dreams14Embed"
