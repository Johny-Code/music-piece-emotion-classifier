Nah, cut them balls\n'Cause I heard you like giving up the drawers\nGang-banged by your manager, fella\nGetting money out your ass like a motherfucking ready teller\nGiving up the dollar bills\nNow they got The Villain with a purse and high-heels\nSo don't believe what Ren say\n'Cause he's going out like Kunta Kinte\nBut I got a whip for you, Toby\nUsed to be my homie, now you act like you don't know me\nIt's a case of divide and conquer\n'Cause you let a Jew break up my crew\nHouse nigga gotta run and hide\nYelling Compton, but you moved to Riverside\nSo don't front, MC Ren\n'Cause I remember when you drove a B210\nBroke as a motherfucking joke\nLet you on the scene to back up the first team\nIt ain't my fault, one nigga got smart\nAnd they ripping your asshole apart\nBy taking your green\nOh, yeah, The Villain does get fucked with no Vaseline\n[Chorus]\nNow you're getting done\u2014 get\u2014 getting done\nNow you're getting done\u2014 get\u2014 getting done\nNow you're getting done without Va\u2014 Va\u2014 Va\u2014 Va\u2014 Vaseline\n\n[Verse 3]\nI never have dinner with the president\nI never have dinner with the president\nI never have dinner with the president\nAnd when I see your ass again, I'll be hesitant\nNow I think you a snitch\nThrow a house nigga in a ditch\nHalf pint bitch, fucking your homeboys, you little maggot\nEazy-E turned faggot\nWith your manager, fella\nFucking MC Ren, Dr. Dre, and Yella\nBut if they were smart as me\nEazy-E would be hanging from a tree\nWith no Vaseline\nJust a match and a little bit of gasoline\nLight 'em up, burn 'em up, flame on\n'Til that Jheri curl is gone\nOn a permanent vacation\nOff the massa plantation\nHeard you both got the same bank account\nDumb nigga, what you thinking 'bout?\nGet rid of that devil real simple\nPut a bullet in his temple\n'Cause you can't be the Nigga 4 Life crew\nWith a white Jew telling you what to do\nPulling wools with your scams\nNow I gotta play The Silence of the Lambs\nWith a midget who's a punk too\nTryin' to fuck me, but I'd rather fuck you\nEric Wright\nPunk, always into something, gettin' fucked at night\nBy Mister Shitpacker\nBend over for the goddamn cracker\nNo Vaseline\n\n[Outro]\nMotherfuckin' nosejob havin'-ass\nMotherfuckin' Jheri Curl light, Ambi wearing motherfuckin' bitch105Embed"
