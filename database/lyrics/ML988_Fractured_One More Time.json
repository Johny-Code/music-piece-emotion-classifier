Just fucking choke\n\nOne more time I'm left broken\nOne more time words unspoken\nOne more time emptiness inside\nOne more time I'm living a lie\n\nWasted time is all I have left, the broken promises I kept. Oblivious to you, oblivious to me you can't handle reality\n\nOne more time I'm left broken\nOne more time words unspoken\nOne more time emptiness inside\nOne more time I'm living a lie\nYou - will never fade awayYou might also likeEmbed"
