This one is for the MCs in Carolina\nThree in the morning, insomnia rhymers\nThat say, \"Yo, let's put the drama behind us, just let the beats rock\"\nStarted cypher while the wack niggas eavesdrop\n9th mouse clicked it on the b-box\n9th always hit me on my sweet spot\nGo to the crib, drink some Peach Schnapps\nAnd doze off to Pete Rock, what\n\n[Chorus: Phonte]\nFor the 9-1-9, for the 9-1-9\nWhen the Sun go down, we still shine and vine\nStill shine and vine, for the 9-1-9\nAnd the 9-1-9, and the 3-3-6\nWhen the nighttime come, that's how we do that shit\nThat's how we, that's how we do that shit\nAiyo this is for the 9-1-9, for the 9-1-9\nWhen the sun go down, we still shine and vine\nStill shine and vine, for the 9-1-9\nAnd the 9-1-9, and the 3-3-6\nWhen the nighttime come, that's how we do that shit\nThat's how we, that's how we do that shit\nYou might also like[Outro]\n{\"When the nighttime covers the city\"} - Mos Def\nYeah, eh-yeaaah\nEh-yaaaay, uh-huh\nOoooooooh, nighttime...\nNighttime....\nNighttime....Embed"
