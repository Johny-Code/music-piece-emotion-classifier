Young punk had to pay\nSo I just killed the man\nYou might also like[Chorus 1]\nHere is something you can't understand\nHow I could just kill a man\nHere is something you can't understand\nHow I could just kill a man\nHere is something you can't understand\nHow I could just kill a man\nHere is something you can't understand\n\n[Bridge]\nIt's gonna be a long time before I finish\nOne of the many missions that I have to establish\nTo light my spliff, ignite you with these site\nSo if you ain't down\nBullshit\n\n[Verse 3]\nSay some punk tried to get you for your auto\nWould call the one time and play the role model?\nNo, I think you'll play like a thug\nNext, hear the shot of a magnum slug\nHumming, coming at ya!\nYeah, you know I'm gonna to gat ya\nHow do you know where I'm at\nWhen you haven't been where I've been?\nUnderstand where I'm coming from\nWhile you're up on the hill in your big home\nI'm out here risking my dome, just for a bucket, or a fast ducat\nJust to stay alive, yo, I gotta say, \"Fuck it\"\n[Refrain]\nHere is something you can't understand\nHow I could just kill a man\nHere is something you can't understand\nHow I could just kill a man\nHere is something you can't understand\nHow I could just kill a man\nHere is something you can't understand\nHow I could just kill a man\nHere is something you can't understand\nHow I could just kill a man\nHere is something you can't understand\nHow I could just kill a man\nHere is something you can't understand\nHow I could just kill a man\nHere is something you can't understand\nHow I could just kill a man\nHere is something you can't understand\nHow I could just kill a man\nHere is something you can't understand\nHow I could just kill a man\nHere is something you can't understand\nHow I could just kill a man\nHere is something you can't understand\nHow I could just kill a man\n\n[Outro]\nHow I could just kill a man\nHow I could just kill a man2Embed"
