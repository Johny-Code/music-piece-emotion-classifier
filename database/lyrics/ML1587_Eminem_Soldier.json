As soon as I pull it, you sweat bullets\nAn excellent method to get rid of the next bully\nIt's actually better 'cause instead of you murderin'\nYou can hurt 'em and come back again and kick dirt at 'em\nIt's like pourin' salt in the wounds, assault and get sued\nYou can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room\nEverybody halts and stops, calls the cops\nAll you see is bitches comin' out their halter tops\nRunnin' and duckin' out the Hot Rocks parking lot\nYou'll all get shot, whether it's your fault or not, 'cause I'm a\u2014\nYou might also like[Chorus]\n(I'm a soldier)\nThese shoulders hold up so much\nThey won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up\n(I'm a soldier)\nEven if my collarbones crush or crumble\nI will never slip or stumble\n(I'm a soldier)\nThese shoulders hold up so much\nThey won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up\n(I'm a soldier)\nEven if my collarbones crush or crumble\nI will never stumble\n\n[Verse 3]\nI spit it slow so these kids know that I'm talkin' to 'em\nGive it back to these damn critics and sock it to 'em\nI'm like a thug with a little bit of Pac influence\nI spew it, and look how I got you bitches rockin' to it\nYou motherfuckers could never do it like I could do it\nDon't even try it, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it\nDon't ever in your life try to knock the truest\nI spit the illest shit ever been dropped in two-inch\nSo ticky-tock, listen as the sound ticks on the clock\nListen to the sound of Kim as she licks on a cock\nListen to the sound of me spillin' my heart through this pen\nMotherfuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again\nFull of controversy until I retire my jersey\n'Til the fire inside dies and expires at thirty\nAnd Lord, have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me\nAnd put a curse on authorities, in the face of adversity, I'm a\u2014\n[Chorus]\n(I'm a soldier)\nThese shoulders hold up so much\nThey won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up\n(I'm a soldier)\nEven if my collarbones crush or crumble\nI will never slip or stumble\n(I'm a soldier)\nThese shoulders hold up so much\nThey won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up\n(I'm a soldier)\nEven if my collarbones crush or crumble\nI will never stumble\n\n[Outro]\nYo, left, yo, left, yo, left, right, left\nYo, left, yo, left, yo, left, right, left\nYo, left, yo, left, yo, left, right, left\nYo, left, yo, left, yo, left, right, left148Embed"
