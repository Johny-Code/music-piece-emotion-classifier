Lyrics[Verse 1]\nWill there be enough water when my ship comes in?\nWater when my ship comes in?\nWill there be water when my ship comes in?\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd when I set sail will there be enough wind?\nAnd when I set sail will there be enough wind?\nAnd when I set sail will there be enough wind?\nCool water,  oh cool wind\n[Verse 3]\nJust because you caught me, does that make it a sin?\nYeah, just because you caught me, does that make it a sin?\nCool water and the cool wind\n\n[Outro]\nEnough water when my ship comes in?\nBe enough water when my ship comes in?\nOh when I set sail will there be enough wind? Yeah\nOh cool water, yeah, and a cool wind\nJust because you caught me, does it make it a sin?\nJust because you caught me, does that make it a sin?You might also like1Embed"
