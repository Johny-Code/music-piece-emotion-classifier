You don't come home to me (No! Oh no!)\nWhen you don't come home to me, can't deal, can't bear (Man)\nYou keep tellin' me lies, but to your surprise\nLook, I found her red coat and you're (Bitch!) caught out there\n\n[Chorus]\nI hate you so much right now! I hate you so much right now!\nAaaaaaaaaaaah! I hate you so much right now!\nI hate you so much right now! I hate you so much right now!\nAaaaaaaaaaaah! I hate you so much right now!\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo sick of your games, I'll set your truck to flames\nAnd watch it blow up, blow up - tell me, how you gonna see her now?\nSo far from sincere, fabrications in my ear (I love you)\nDrive me so far up the wall, I come slidin' down\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhat is this I see? You don't come home to me (I don't believe this!)\nWhen you don't come home to me, I can't deal, can't bear (I won't)\nYou keep tellin' me lies, but to your surprise\nLook, I hope you're happy since you're caught out there\nYou might also like[Interlude]\nYeah, you've been caught\nYo, come on\nCome on\n\n[Chorus]\nI hate you so much right now! I hate you so much right now!\nAaaaaaaaaaaah! I hate you so much right now!\nI hate you so much right now! I hate you so much right now!\nAaaaaaaaaaaah! I hate you so much right now!\n\n[Verse 3]\nShe's so raunchy, so vulgar; not me, why the hell her?\nLook, she dresses a mess, what do you see? (Look at her! I don't know)\nIt's not all about cash, nor how much you flash (Hell no)\nHow I dress is a reflection of me\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhat is this I see? You don't come home to me (Uh-uh)\nWhen you don't come home to me, can't deal, can't bear (Told you I won't)\nYou keep tellin' me lies, but to your surprise\nLook I got something for y'all since you're caught out there\n\n[Chorus]\nI hate you so much right now! I hate you so much right now!\nAaaaaaaaaaaah! I hate you so much right now!\nI hate you so much right now! I hate you so much right now!\nAaaaaaaaaaaah! I hate you so much right now!\nI hate you so much right now! I hate you so much right now!\nAaaaaaaaaaaah! I hate you so much right now!\nI hate you so much right now! I hate you so much right now!\nAaaaaaaaaaaah! I hate you so much right now!3Embed"
