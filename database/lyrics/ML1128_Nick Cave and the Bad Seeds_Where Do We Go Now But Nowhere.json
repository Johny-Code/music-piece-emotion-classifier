Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI remember a girl so very well\nThe carnival drums all mad in the air\nGrim reapers and skeletons and a missionary bell\nOh, where do we go now but nowhere?\nIn a colonial hotel we fucked up the sun\nAnd then we fucked it down again\nWell, the sun comes up and the sun goes down\nGoing 'round and around to nowhere\nThe kitten that padded and purred on my lap\nNow swipes at my face with the paw of a bear\nI turn the other cheek and you lay into that\nOh, where do we go now but nowhere?\n[Chorus]\nOh, wake up, my love\nMy lover, wake up\nOh, wake up, my love\nMy lover, wake up\n\n[Verse 2]\nAcross clinical benches with nothing to talk\nBreathing tea and biscuits and the Serenity Prayer\nWhile the bones of our child crumble like chalk\nOh, where do we go now but nowhere?\nI remember a girl so bold and so bright\nLoose-limbed and laughing and brazen and bare\nSits gnawing her knuckles in the chemical light\nOh, where do we go now but nowhere?\nYou come for me now with a cake that you've made\nRavaged avenger with a clip in your hair\nFull of glass and bleach and my old razorblades\nOh, where do we go now but nowhere?\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, wake up, my love\nMy lover, wake up\nOh, wake up, my love\nMy lover, make up\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nIf they'd give me my clothes back then I could go home\nFrom this fresh, this clean, antiseptic air\nBehind the locked gates an old donkey moans\nWhere do we go now but nowhere?\nAround the duck pond we grimly mope\nGloomily and mournfully we go 'round again\nAnd one more doomed time and without much hope\nGoing 'round and around to nowhere\nFrom the balcony we watched the carnival band\nThe crack of the drum, a little child did scare\nI can still feel his fingers pressed in my hand\nOh, where do we go now but nowhere?\nIf I could relive one day of my life\nIf I could relive just a single one\nYou on the balcony, my future wife\nOh, who could have known but no one?\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, wake up, my love\nMy lover, wake up\nWake up, my love\nMy lover, wake up\nOh, wake up, my love\nMy lover, wake up\nOh, wake up, my love\nMy lover, wake up2Embed"
