Yes please, haha!)\n\n[Verse 1]\nI cannot sleep\nThere's too much noise in my head!\nI cannot sleep\nI want it here instead!\n\n[Chorus 1]\nI never thought that this could come to this\nI just wanna look at your face in peace now\nYou will never miss\nBut I can't!\n(Ha ha ha!)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI cannot keep\nThe shame that's clawed us out!\nAnd I will not keep\nYour shut up, shut up lies!\n\n[Chorus 2]\nI never thought that this could come to this\nI just wanna live in bliss, in peace now\nYou will never miss\nBut I can!\n\n(Ha ha ha!)You might also like2Embed"
