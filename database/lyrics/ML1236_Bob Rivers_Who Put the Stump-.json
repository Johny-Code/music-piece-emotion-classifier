LyricsI'd like to find the guy\nWho done me wrong\nAnd stuck my butt up\nOn this Christmas tree\n\nWho put the stump\nIn my rump-ba-bump-ba-bump?\nWho took and jammed it\nIn my ram-a-lam-a-ding dong?\nWho stood the wood\nWhere I poop-she-poop-she-poop?\nWho put the stick\nUp my hipty-dipty-dip?\nWho was that man?\nHe shoved it up my can\nAnd left me stranded on this Christmas tree. (Yeah ...)\n\nWhen this angel heard\nChop-ba-ba-bop, di-chop-ba-ba-bop\nA dreadful fear went right into my heart\nThose pine tree needles sting me\nRam-a-jam-a-ram-a-jammin' in my ding dong\nYou'll never know how much that smarts. (Hooah ...)\n\nSo who put the stump\nIn my rump-ba-bump-ba-bump?\nWho took and jammed it\nIn my ram-a-lam-a-ding dong?\nWho stood the wood\nWhere I poop-she-poop-she-poop?\nWho put the stick\nUp my hipty-dipty-dip?\n\nWho took that bush\nAnd crammed it in my tush?\nHe made this angel beg for mercy, please. (Yow ...)\n\nEach night when I'm alone\nScratchity scratchity scratchity scratchity\nScratchity scratchity shoop ...\nIt sets my tiny bottom all aglow\nAnd every time I wiggle\nSlipty-din-de-din, slipty-din-de-din\nA little further in it goes. (Ohhh/Yeah ...)\nYou might also like(Rump-ba-bump-ba-bump\nRam-a-lam-a ding dong\nSlipty-din-de-din\nPoopity poopity shoop ...)Embed"
