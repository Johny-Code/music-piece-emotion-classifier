Yes I asked\nWould she walk with me a while\nThrough this night so vast\nShe took my hand, this lovely creature\n\"Yes\", she said, \"Yes\", she said\n\"Yes, I'll walk with you a while\"\nIt was a joyful man she led\n[Verse 2]\nOver hills, this lovely creature\nOver mountains, over ranges\nBy great pyramids and sphinxs\nWe met drifters and strangers\nOh the sands, my lovely creature\nAnd the mad, moaning winds\nAt night the deserts writhed\nWith diabolical things\nThrough the night, through the night\nThe wind lashed and it whipped me\nWhen I got home, my creature\nWas no longer with me\nSomewhere she lies, this lovely creature\nBeneath the slow drifting sands\nWith her hair full of ribbons\nAnd green gloves on her handsYou might also like1Embed"
