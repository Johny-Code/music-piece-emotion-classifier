        "lyrics": "Institutionalized Lyrics[Verse 1]\nSometimes, I try to do things\nAnd it just doesn't work out the way I want it to\nAnd I get real frustrated\nAnd like, I try hard to do it\nAnd I like, take my time, but it just doesn't work out the way I want it to\nIt's like I concentrate on it real hard\nBut it just doesn't work out\nAnd everything I do and everything I try\nIt never turns out\nIt's like, I need time to figure these things out\nBut there's always someone there going\n\"Hey Mike, you know, we've been noticing you've been having a lot of problems lately, you know?\nYou should maybe get away\nAnd like, maybe you should talk about it, you'll feel a lot better\"\nAnd I go, \"No it's okay, you know, I'll figure it out\nJust leave me alone, I'll figure it out, you know?\nI'm just working on myself\"\nThey go, \"Well you know, if you want to talk about it, I'll be here, you know\nAnd you'll probably feel a lot better if you talk about it\nSo why don't you talk about it?\"\nI go, \"No I don't want to, I'm okay! I'll figure it out myself!\"\nBut they just keep bugging me\nThey just keep bugging me and it builds up inside\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSo you're gonna be institutionalized\nYou'll come out brainwashed with bloodshot eyes\nYou won't have any say\nThey'll brainwash you until you see their way\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm not crazy! (Institution!)\nYou're the one that's crazy! (Institution!)\nYou're driving me crazy! (Institution!)\nThey stick me in an institution\nAnd said it was the only solution\nTo give me the needed professional help\nTo protect from the enemy, myself\n\n[Verse 2]\nI was in my room\nAnd I was just like, staring at the walls thinking about everything\nBut then again, I was thinking about nothing\nAnd then my mom came in, and I didn't even know she was there\nShe called my name and I didn't hear her\nAnd then she started screaming, \"Mike! Mike!\"\nAnd I go, \"What? What's the matter?\"\nShe goes, \"What's the matter with you?\"\nI go, \"There's nothing wrong, mom\"\nShe goes, \"Don't tell me that, you're on drugs!\"\nI go, \"No mom, I'm not on drugs, I'm okay, I'm just thinking, you know? Why don't you get me a Pepsi?\"\nShe goes, \"No! You're on drugs!\"\nI go, \"Mom, I'm okay, I'm just thinking\"\nAnd she goes, \"No! You're not thinking, you're on drugs!\nNormal people don't act that way!\"\nI go, \"Mom, just get me a Pepsi, please? All I want's a Pepsi\"\nAnd she wouldn't give it to me\nAll I wanted was a Pepsi\nJust one Pepsi\nAnd she wouldn't give it to me\nJust a Pepsi!\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nThey give you a white shirt with long sleeves\nTied around your back, you're treated like thieves\nDrug you up because they're lazy\nIt's too much work to help a crazy\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm not crazy! (Institution!)\nYou're the one that's crazy! (Institution!)\nYou're driving me crazy! (Institution!)\nThey stick me in an institution\nSaid it was the only solution\nTo give me the needed professional help\nTo protect from the enemy, myself\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm sitting in my room, and my mom and my dad came in\nThey pulled up a chair and they sat down\nThey go, \"Mike, we need to talk to you\"\nAnd I go, \"Okay, what's the matter?\"\nThey go, \"Me and your mom, we've been noticing lately you've been having a lot of problems\nAnd you've been going off for no reason\nAnd we're afraid you're gonna hurt somebody\nAnd we're afraid you're gonna hurt yourself,\nSo we decided that it would be in your best interest if we put you somewhere you could get the help that you need\"\nAnd I go, \"Wait, what are you talking about?\nWe decided?! My best interest?!\nHow do you know what my best interest is?\nHow can you say what my best interest is?\nWhat are you trying to say? I'm crazy?!\nWhen I went to your schools\nI went to your churches\nI went to your institutional learning facilities!\nSo how can you say I'm crazy?!\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThey say they're gonna fix my brain\nAlleviate my suffering and my pain\nBut by the time they fix my head\nMentally, I'll be dead\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm not crazy! (Institution!)\nYou're the one that's crazy! (Institution!)\nYou're driving me crazy! (Institution!)\nThey stick me in an institution\nSaid it was the only solution\nTo give me the needed professional help\nTo protect from the enemy, myself\n\n[Outro]\nIt doesn't matter, I'll probably get hit by a car anyway13Embed"
