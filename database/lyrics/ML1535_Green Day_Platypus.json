        "lyrics": "PLATYPUS Lyrics[Verse 1: Henry Draw]\nMan, I have been liftin\u2019 all the supplements like I came from the gym\nI know what I\u2019ll do today, calculated, not a whim\nIf my diet never changes, face to face with Grim\nBut if my family never eatin\u2019 then we live like Tiny Tim\nAren\u2019t you a little too young? Who you to say that?\nYou doing in the rag, but cannot hide it, no wave cap\nI\u2019m on a fuckin\u2019 rampage, but I turn back with a snap\nYou hear \u201cgrrt, grrt,\u201d is that Perry or my gat?\nYou do not understand the fundamentals\nI switch up my flow like the notes on portamentos\nWe gonna fizz and then we pop just like some Coke and Mentos\nNothing is gonna stop us, because our work is essential\nMy stash is being shaved and is lowered by the fuckin\u2019 day\nWas rolling in the green, but now the numbers in the gray\nIt\u2019s not an issue, we gon\u2019 go up, up, away\nI\u2019m a fuckin\u2019 Bronze Eagle, fans like it that way\n[Chorus: Noah Murray]\nPlatypus, big bills, hiding in my pocket\nMaking money in the palace, dunking on ya, Ben Wallace\nWhat the fuck, I need to use some logic\nThey won\u2019t let me drive the boat, but I\u2019m still gonna rock it\nPlatypus, big bills, hiding in my pocket\nMaking money in the palace, dunking on ya, Ben Wallace\nWhat the fuck, I need to use some logic\nThey won\u2019t let me drive the boat, but I\u2019m still gonna rock it\n\n[Verse 2: Ryan Dove]\nI got the magic, just like I\u2019m Houdini\nSpeeding through traffic, hope twelve doesn\u2019t see me\nYou wanna beat me, well, you\u2019ll need a genie\nTo grant you three wishes, \u2018cause I\u2019m three times better than you\nSomebody tell these dudes to stop starin\u2019 at me\nAll y\u2019all sound like parrots to me\nI be on my secret agent shit, call me Perry\nI\u2019m the big dog, you a mouse like Jerry\n\n[Verse 3: Young Kippur]\nClockin\u2019 in these hours, money, gettin\u2019 that peso\nMan, I\u2019ve been getting really rich, these bitches callin\u2019 me Bezos\nI\u2019ma just make that shit not trickle when I\u2019m hoarding it up\nI\u2019ll pack it right up in my basement, bitch, I\u2019m storing it up\nI\u2019mma be just rippin\u2019 on a trap beat, packs in the backseat\nBud out the ass, run that shit like a track meet\nMade a rude bitch get bloody, no maxi\nCatch me up on Fallon freestyle, word to taxi\nLaid back on a cruise, I got a glass of sangria\nI\u2019m a big boss, got tacos, tortilla\nI\u2019mma get naked and upset, call me Mia\nWith a contract that I signed saying \u201cwhat\u2019s yo\u2019 idea?\u201d\nOh no, there\u2019s a platypus controlling me\nHe\u2019s gripping, got a hold of me, I\u2019m spinning like a rotary and bang\nSo they see me hatching, call me Togepi, the bottom of the totem piece\nI\u2019m holding us together like chains\nYou might also like[Chorus: Noah Murray]\nPlatypus, big bills, hiding in my pocket\nMaking money in the palace, dunking on ya, Ben Wallace\nWhat the fuck, I need to use some logic\nThey won\u2019t let me drive the boat, but I\u2019m still gonna rock it\nPlatypus, big bills, hiding in my pocket\nMaking money in the palace, dunking on ya, Ben Wallace\nWhat the fuck, I need to use some logic\nThey won\u2019t let me drive the boat, but I\u2019m still gonna rock it\n\n[Verse 4: Julien Sword]\nI been making friends with the government, I\u2019ma beat the case up\nI\u2019ma hand my mic to the audience, I don't need a setlist\nFucked my fam\u2019 up wit\u2019 them pills, I never need a medic\nLiving like a new kid should, I'm fucking innovative\nYoung businessman, made dinner plans with a couple friends\nCancelled it, now I gotta find a different fit to wear\nChilling in a rocking chair, couple kids sipping sangria\nLike I made it here, summer house in Montclair\nRun it back to Bayville, I was just a kid then\nWish that I could go back, when I knew that I was big dog\nNow I'm just a misfit, mistake bottom of the barrel like I been scraping\nBut that's just the foresight of a hindseer, blinding like some high beams\nSweeter than some syrup, dirty soda make me dry heave\nBaby, pass the visine, I need to cry real tears more\nBut I can't even stomach the pain\n[Verse 5: Battle Cove]\nA frantic artist up in here, open your ears\nGot the rest of y'all feeling like I'm chillin\u2019 on a different tier\nYou should fear the mere mention of my name\nI'm not the same, feel like my tunes got insane\nThese sonic sounds in my ears\nHelped me walk through these past three years\nEvery plan that fell through\nEvery night I sat up wondering about you, and you, and you\n\n[Chorus: Noah Murray]\nPlatypus, big bills, hiding in my pocket\nMaking money in the palace, dunking on ya, Ben Wallace\nWhat the fuck, I need to use some logic\nThey won\u2019t let me drive the boat, but I\u2019m still gonna rock it\nPlatypus, big bills, hiding in my pocket\nMaking money in the palace, dunking on ya, Ben Wallace\nWhat the fuck, I need to use some logic\nThey won\u2019t let me drive the boat, but I\u2019m still gonna rock it\nPlatypus, big bills, hiding in my pocket\nMaking money in the palace, dunking on ya, Ben Wallace\nWhat the fuck, I need to use some logic\nThey won\u2019t let me drive the boat, but I\u2019m still gonna rock it\nPlatypus, big bills, hiding in my pocket\nMaking money in the palace, dunking on ya, Ben Wallace\nWhat the fuck, I need to use some logic\nThey won\u2019t let me drive the boat, but I\u2019m still gonna rock itEmbed"
