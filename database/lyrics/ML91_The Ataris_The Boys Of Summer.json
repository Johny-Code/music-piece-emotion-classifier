(Crazy)\nRemember how I made you scream?\nBut I don't understand what happened to our love\nBut baby, when I get you back\nI'm gonna show you what I'm made of\n\n[Chorus]\nI can see you\nYour brown skin shinin' in the sun\nI see you walkin' real slow and you're\nSmilin' at everyone\nBut I can tell you my love for you will still be strong\nAfter the boys of summer have gone\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Verse 3]\nOut on the road today\nI saw a Black Flag sticker on a Cadillac\nA little voice inside my head said:\n\"Don't look back, you can never look back.\"\nI thought I knew what love was, what did I know?\nThose days are gone forever\nI should just let 'em go, but\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI can see you\nYour brown skin shinin' in the sun\nYou got that top pulled down and that\nRadio on, baby\nNow I can tell you my love for you will still be strong\nAfter the boys of summer have gone\nI can see you\nYour brown skin shinin' in the sun\nYou got that hair slicked back and those\nWayfarers on, baby\nI can tell you my love for you will still be strong\nAfter the boys of summer have gone5Embed"
