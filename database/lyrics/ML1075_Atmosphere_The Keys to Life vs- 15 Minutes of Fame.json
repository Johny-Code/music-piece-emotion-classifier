We're gonna have the maintenance technicians come over\nAnd take a look at it and uh once that's done, then we'll give you an estimate\nI'd say it's probably at least uh 15 minutes or so.\"\n\n[Verse 1]\nIt's like all of Franklin Avenue now sleeps upon my chest (my chest)\nI've used cigarette butts and looseleaf to build my nest (build my nest)\nDid I mention I appreciate the way you treat your guests? (guess not)\nBut I'm not really convinced when you say that you're impressed (hell no)\nThe line between MC and comedian gets a little thinner (little thinner)\nNow it's nothing but roughage for lunch and punchlines for dinner (feed me)\nI've tried to open the blinds to let in some sunshine\nWound the watch 'til it broke all in hopes of stopping the time\n[Hook]\nThe key broke off in the ignition\nHopping if I wandered off through my thoughts wishing\nHoping this could be for you, but it is for me\nPatiently I stay busy, I wait, I see (X2)\nIt's the sure shot (X6)\n\nZih Zih Zih Zih Zih\n\n[Verse 2]\nSee it's simple (simple), it's not that I want to make it ripple (ripple)\nBut I feel I'm only being civil (civil)\nWhen I sit back and giggle like the rest as the rhythm manifests\nI'm stressed (stressed), but most of 'em would never guess (never guess)\nThat I'm closing in upon the crest\nWhy? Cause I think it'd be best for who? To hide the mess from who?\nIt's all true (it's all true), not good, but I know it'll do (it'll do)\nStill trying to reach the kid in you\nSo I may continue to find why this child proves so wild\nI smile (smile), tired, I walked a thousand miles (miles)\nWired over the thoughts I've dialed (dialed)\nInspired by the monsters, the files of life full of stars and stripes\n\n[Hook]\nYou might also like(Chorus End)\nIf you wanna sleep with me and talk about existence\nWe'll need more than 15 minutes\nI'll tell you what, let's forget about the fame\nPush pause on the game and get to know each other by our real names\nIf you wanna sleep with me and talk about existence\nWe'll need more than 15 minutes\nI'll tell you what, let's forget about the fame\nPush pause on the game and get to know each other by our first names\nIf you wanna sit with me and talk about existence\nWe'll need more than 15 minutes\nI'll tell you what, let's forget about the fame\nPush pause on the game... What the fuck's your name?Embed"
