LyricsI'm the lucky one always having fun\nI tie back my hair\n\nI sit and watch t.v\nI see only me\nThough I look for you there\n\nOh where have you gone\nWere you cancelled?\nI change to channel two\nYou were the one\nWho gave me all my answers\nI changed\nSo did you\nTry another show\nWith the volume low\nI make up what they say\nWhere it used to be your face\nIs an empty space\nYour co-stars look away\n\nOh, where have you gone\nAnd do you miss me\nAnd what we used to do?\nYou were the one\nWho'd talk and smile for a half an hour\nAlways new\n\nI'm the lucky one\nI watch a re-run\nIt looks a lot like you\nOne star lost a family\nOne family lost a star\nThat's why I wait and watch\nTo find out where you are\nOne family lost a star\nOne star, they lost their family\nThat's why I sit at home alone\nAnd watch t.v\nYou might also likeI can watch forever\nI can watch for hours\nIt just gets better\nIt gives me the power\nI can watch or hours\nI could watch forever\nIt gives me pleasure\nIt makes me better\n\nI'm the lucky one\nAlways having funEmbed"
