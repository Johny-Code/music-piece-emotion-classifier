Woah\nEach time she's kissed you, tell me\nIs it that really that good for you?\n\n[Pre-Chorus 1: Nadine]\nDoes she love you like I never could?\nHold you tender tell you everything's good? Woah\nWould she hurt you? 'Cause I never could\nDoes she hold your body tight all night baby?\n\n[Chorus: Nadine]\nI'm talking 'bout a whole lotta history\nI can't find a way to show what you mean to me\nI've fallen all around when you miss me\nI don't know what to do so tell me baby\n\n[Verse 2: Nicola]\nHello, did you call me?\nI thought it didn't matter that you're gone\nAnd I know, end of story\nNow there's nothing but a shadow where my heart shone\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2: Nadine]\nI'm damned if I do and I'm damned and if I don't\nBut you cost me so much love, yeah\nSo finally I just decided to go\nI know I've had enough, so tell me that you're not alone\nYou might also like[Chorus: Nadine]\nI'm talking 'bout a whole lotta history\nI can't find a way to show what you mean to me\nI've fallen all around when you miss me\nI don't know what to do so tell me baby\nI'm talking 'bout a whole lotta history\nI can't find a way to show what you mean to me\nI've fallen all around when you miss me\nI don't know what to do so tell me baby\n\n[Outro: Sarah (Fade Out)]\nAnd it keeps me spinning\nAnd controls what happens 'til Monday, 'til Monday\nAnd it might sound crazy\nBut your voice still leaves me all funky, all funky\nAnd it keeps me spinning\nAnd controls what happens 'til Monday, 'til Monday\nAnd it might sound crazy\nBut your voice still leaves me all funky, all funkyEmbed"
