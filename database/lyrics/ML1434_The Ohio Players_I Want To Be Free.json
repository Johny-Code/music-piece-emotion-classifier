And he has his brother here right\nAnd he punches a cop, oh man\nI want to talk to Lou about the answer to life\nAnd why, why are you booing me?\nSo next time your wondering, and I don't live that far from here\nLike I can say \"Wow man\" I get out of the limo and there's going to be the dragon with a cape saying \"All your sins and then some.\"\nAnd I say \"But I'm not Catholic Jack\"\nThe Umbrella man is on Rikers Island studying to be a dentist\nYou remember him? With the cape?\n[Audience Member]\nHey Lou!\n\n[Lou Reed]\nWhat?\nSuprise you huh?\nWhat you think this is question and answer?\n[?]\nIt's not my fault man\n28,000 years ago come on, come on, come on\nI don't have anything to say\nI just want it to be quiet I've been here a week\nYou think that's an accomplishment?\nI think that's something you're sentenced to\nAnd if you don't get that, you get to play here [?]\n2 hours with 14,000 animals throwing beer cans at you\nAh, but that's Rock'n'roll bullshit\nNot behind my back it ain't\nI stand corrected Michael\n\nWe know the rhythm come on\nAin't a metronome\nDon't you show any passion\nIf you'd show any emotion I'd fire you\nI am not sure, we did this song all week and\nIt's not like I don't want to play your favorites it's just...\nThere's so many favorites to choose from\nNo?\nThe thing is I was so sick of that song\nAnd I don't get sick of my own songs, I like my own songs\nSo, we hadn't done her in a while\nBut it's only doing it at night\nAnd It's not cause I like it, It's cause I'm not bored with it\nEverybody gets bored of somebody sometimes\nExcept me, I'm lonely\nMe and my several selves discuss it at night\nLou #1 and Lou, Lou #5\nHello\nIs that you again? Reformer\nMea Culpa\nYou might also likeHolly came from Miami F.L.A\nI have no attitude without a cigarette\nI'd rather have cancer than be a faggot\nThat wasn't an anti-gay remark\nComing from me man that's a compliment\nLike going to bed with a brontosaurus, man\nIt's out of style, Whats its style?\nNothing is its style man\nHave you gotten into nothing yet?\nWhy not, cause its nothing\nSaturday night man where do you want to go\nWatch me turn into Lou Reed before your very eyes!\nAhhh\nI do Lou Reed better than anybody!\nSo I thought I'd get in on it\nEnough attitude to kill every person in Jersey\nAsk him if it's scientific\n\nHolly came from Miami F.L.A\nHitchhiked, hitchhike - All the way across the U.S.A\nPlucked her eyebrows along the way\nShaved her legs and said he was a she\nAnd then she said\n\"Why don't you take a walk on the wild side?\"\n\"Why don't you take a walk on the wild side?\"\nWould you like to know how that song got written?\nI know you'd been dying to ask\nDoes that sound like Holly Woodlawn? That's an in-joke I guess\nBelieve it or not, the first time I quit Rock'n'roll\nBecause of too many lawsuits\n'Cause I could not afford my lawyers\nI still can't but now I got the government as partners\nFantastic, I get the government, like a week, you know\nIn Puerto Rico, in a nice hotel\nAnd your like what are you complaining about asshole?\nI just play guitar man\n\nHi Bruce\n\nSpringsteen is alright, by the way\nHe gets my seal of approval, I think he's groovy\nYou notice the way the critics turned on him\nLike after they were on him right?\nWhen he needed him, they weren't there\nCritics\nWhat does Robert Christgau do in bed?\nYou know, is he a toe-fucker?\nMan, anal-retentive\u2014The Consumer\u2019s Guide to Rock?\nWhat a moron!\nA Consumer\u2019s Guide to Rock, man!

And he\u2019s a big dude\nSomebody should say, \u201cJohn, don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d\nAnd Christgau is like an anal-retentive\nNice little boxes. \u201cB-plus.\u201d Can you imagine working for a fucking year and you got a B-plus from an asshole in The Village Voice?\nAnd you don\u2019t gotta take this shit\nYou don\u2019t have to talk to the fucking journalists, man.
