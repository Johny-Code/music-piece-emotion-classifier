You can never look back.\"\nI thought I knew what love was\nWhat did I know?\nThose days are gone forever\nI should just let them go but\n\nI can see you\nYour brown skin shinin' in the sun\nYou got that hair slicked back and those Wayfarers on, baby\nAnd I can tell you my love for you will still be strong\nAfter the boys of summer have gone\nYou might also likeAnd I can tell you my love for you will still be strong\nAfter the boys of summer have goneEmbed"
