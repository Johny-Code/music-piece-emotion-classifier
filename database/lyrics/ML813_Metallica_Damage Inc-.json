Lyrics[Bass Intro]\n\n[Verse 1]\nDealing out the agony within\nCharging hard, and no one's going to give in\nLiving on your knees, conformity\nOr dying on your feet for honesty\nInbred, our bodies work as one\nBloody, but never cry submission\nFollowing our instinct not a trend\nGo against the grain until the end\n[Chorus]\nBlood will follow blood\nDying time is here\n(Damage Incorporated)\n\n[Verse 2]\nSlamming through, don't fuck with razorback\nStepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back\nBlood follows blood, and we make sure\nLife isn't for you, and we're the cure\nHonesty is my only excuse\nTry to rob us of it, but it's no use\nSteamroller action crushing all\nVictim is your name, and you shall fall\n\n[Chorus]\nBlood will follow blood\nDying time is here\n(Damage Incorporated)\n\n[Bridge]\nWe chew and spit you out\nWe laugh, you scream and shout\nAll flee, with fear you run\nYou'll know just where we come from\n(Damage Incorporated)\nGo\nYou might also like[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Verse 3]\nDamage jackals ripping right through you\nSight and smell of this, it gets me going\nKnow just how to get just what we want\nTear it from your soul in nightly hunt\nFuck it all, and fucking no regrets\nNever happy endings on these dark sets\nAll's fair for Damage Inc., you see\nStep a little closer, if you please\n\n[Chorus]\nBlood will follow blood\nDying time is here\n(Damage Incorporated)23Embed"
