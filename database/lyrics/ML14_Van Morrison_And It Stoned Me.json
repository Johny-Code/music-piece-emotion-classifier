There you are\"\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh, the water\nOh, the water\nOh, the water\nGet it myself from the mountain stream\n[Chorus]\nAnd it stoned me to my soul\nStoned me just like Jelly Roll\nAnd it stoned me\nAnd it stoned me to my soul\nStoned me just like goin' home\nAnd it stoned me\nWell it stoned me to my soul\nStoned on me just like Jelly Roll\nAnd it stoned me\nWell it stoned me to my soul\nStoned me just like goin' home\nAnd it stoned meEmbed"
