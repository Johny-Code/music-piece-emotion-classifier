LyricsReceive me - unleash me\n\nI crave the morning quickly come\nI get down on my knees and pray\nAnd hope the dawning pulls me right out (right out) of my dream\n\nYou walk right by my window\nEveryday I can feel you so near\nWhen will you come to get me out (get me out) of my fear\n\nWould you unind me? If you'd finally find me\nI am tied to the ground. Ready to be unbound\nWould you break me out and Would you help me to get out get out? Pull me out!\n\nEach day a new tomorrow\nAnd I long for the same old aim\nI'm bound in bitter sorrow - I know, I want out, but I can't\n\nWould you unleash me? If you'd perceive me\n\nI am tied to the ground. Ready to be unbound\nWould you break me out and Would you help me to get out get out?\n\nI am tied to the ground. Ready to be unbound\nWould you break me out and Would you help me to get out get out? Pull me out!\n\nGet me out - please hear my prayer\nDo you think it'll go that way?\nI get down on my knees and pray\nDo you think it'll go that way?\nI get down on my knees and pray\n\nI am tied to the ground. Get me out just to dry my tears\nReady to be unbound\nYes I pray\n\nWould you break me out and\nWould you help me to get out get out?\nPull me out!You might also likeEmbed"
