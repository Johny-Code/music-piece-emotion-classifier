What more can you do?\nNo more tomorrow, life is killing you\nDreams turn to nightmares, heaven turns to Hell\nBurnt out confusion, nothing more to tell, yeah\nEverything around you, what's it coming to?\nGod knows as your dog nose, bog, blast all of you\nSabbath bloody sabbath, nothing more to do\nLiving just for dying, dying just for you, yeahYou might also like10Embed"
