This is all mine.\"\nBut hasn't your donor card expired?\nFrom Blueridge to Cattail on the prairie\nFrom flyover country, back through Mississippi\nI said, \"Go, man, you go.\"\nBut you raise me twenty, I'm raising you five-\nHundred treaties signed by your fathers' lies\nGo, man, you go\n'Cause I'm trailing her tears\nThe ones you won't hold\nYou roll me a carpet, roll me a carpet, boy\nRoll me a carpet from here to Oklahoma\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nTombigbee, Tombigbee, help me hang these bones\nGotta hang these bones out to dry\nHe loved me, he loved me, ravishingly low\nGotta hang these bones out to dry\nDry, dry, dry\n\n[Outro]\nI'll do it again\nDry, dry, dryEmbed"
