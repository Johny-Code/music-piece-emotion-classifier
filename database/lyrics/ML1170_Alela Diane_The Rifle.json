They're comin' from the woods!\nAnd mama you're running too\nOh! My mama, you're running too\nBrother, I'm so sorry that you watched the paintings burn\nI've been holding onto the gold\nWhen letting go would free my hand\nAnd I've been tying your tongue in a knot\nOh! I've been tying your tongue in a knot\nTo wrap this death\nTo wrap this death in a sheet\n\nPapa, get the rifle from its place above the French doors!\nThey're comin' from the woods!\nOh! They're comin' from the woods!\nAnd mama you're running too\nOh! My mama, you're running too\nBrother, I'm so sorry that you watched the paintings burn\n\nI can't hide the dirty paths down that carpet anymore\nThere were too many heavy boots\nThere were too many heavy boots\nThere were too many big black boots\nAnd there were too many little brown shoes\nMarching through\nSo I'm counting it to the sky\nOh! I'm counting it to the sky\nAnd moving back to face the lack of homeYou might also likeEmbed"
