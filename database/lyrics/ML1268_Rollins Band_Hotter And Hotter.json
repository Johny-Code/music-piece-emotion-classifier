I'm scorching and torching no time for front porching\nHotter and hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter... and hotter\nHotter and hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter\n\nThe days go on and the years go by and I'm hotter and hotter and flying on by\nBetter looking less of same I'm on my way to up the road to the next thing\nYou see me burning hotter and hotter and the years go by\nYou wonder to yourself how come that man hasn't burned out\nDon't ask me why\nGot green lights in front of me\n\nGetting hotter and hotter you see\nHotter and hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter...oh yea\nHotter and hotter and hotte and hotter and hotter you see\nHotter and hotter and hotte and hotter and hotter you see\nGasoline for breakfast, Napalm for lunch\nHotter and hotter and hotte and hotter and hotter... yea ... yea ... yeaYou might also likeEmbed"
