I got no place, no place to go\n[Chorus]\nIt'll be lonely this Christmas without you to hold\nIt'll be lonely this Christmas, lonely and cold\nIt'll be cold, so cold without you to hold\nThis Christmas\n\n[Verse 2]\n(Bom-bom-bom-bom)\nEach time, I remember the day you went away\n(Bom-bom-bom-bom)\nAnd how I would listen to the things you had to say\nI just break down as I look around and the only things I see\nAre emptiness and loneliness and an unlit Christmas tree\n\n[Chorus]\nIt'll be lonely this Christmas without you to hold\nIt'll be lonely this Christmas, lonely and cold\nIt'll be cold, so cold without you to hold\nThis Christmas\n\n[Bridge (Spoken)]\n(Bom-bom-bom-bom)\nYou remember last year, when you and I were together? We never thought there'd be an end, and I remember looking at you and I remember thinkin' that Christmas must've been made for us. [?] darlin', this is the time of year that you really [?], when it means so very, very much\n\n[Refrain (Spoken)]\nIt'll be lonely this Christmas without you to hold\nIt'll be so very, lonely and cold\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nIt'll be lonely this Christmas without you to hold\nIt'll be lonely this Christmas, lonely and cold\nIt'll be cold, so cold without you to hold\nThis Christmas\n\n[Outro (Spoken)]\nMerry Christmas, darlin', wherever you areEmbed"
