Where you at?!\nIn the front! In the back! Killa Beez on attack!\nMy peoples, are you with me? Where you at?!\nSmokin' meth, hittin' cats on the block with the gats!\n[Verse 4: Ol' Dirty Bastard]\nHere I go, deep type flow\nJacques Cousteau could never get this low\nI'm cherry bombin' shits\u2026 BOOM!\nJust warmin' up a little bit (Vroom-vroom!)\nRappinin' is what's happenin'\nKeep the pockets stacked and then hands clap and then\nAt the party when I move my body\nGotta get up and be somebody!\nGrab the microphone, put strength to the bone\nDUH DUH DUH\u2026\u00a0enter the Wu-Tang zone\nSure enough when I rock that stuff, huff, puff\nI'm gonna catch your bluff, tuff, rough\nKickin' rhymes like Jim Kelly\nOr Alex Haley, I'm a nuh\u2026 Beetle Bailey rhymes\nComin' raw style, hardcore\nNiggas be comin' to the hip-hop store\nComin' to buy grocery from me\nPretendin' to be a hip-hop MC\nThe law \u2014 in order to Enter the Wu-Tang\nYou must bring the Ol' Dirty Bastard type slang\nRepresent the GZA, Abbot \u2014 RZA\nShaquan, Inspectah Deck\nDirty Ho gettin' low with his flow\nIntroducin' the Ghostface Killah!\nNo one could get iller!\n[Chorus: Method Man]\nMy peoples, are you with me? Where you at?!\nIn the front! In the back! Killa Beez on attack!\nMy peoples, are you with me? Where you at?!\nSmokin' meth, hittin' cats on the block with the gats!\n[Verse 5: Ghostface Killah]\nSpeakin' of the Devil, psych!\nNo, it's the God, get ya shit right!\nMega trife, and yo, I killed you in a past life\nOn the mic while you was kickin' that fast shit\nYou reneged, tried again, and got blasted\nHalf-mastered-ass style, mad ruff task\nWhen I struck, I had on Timbs and a black mask\nRemember that shit? I know you don't remember jack!\nThat night, yo I was hittin' like a spiked bat!\nUntil you thought I was bugged out and crazy\nStrapped for nonsense, after me became lazy\nYo, nobody budge while I shot slugs\nNever shot thugs, I'm runnin' with thugs that flood mugs\nSo, grab your eight-plus-one, start flippin' and trippin'\nNiggas is jettin', I'm lickin' off, son\n\n[All]\nWu! Tang! Wu! Tang!\nWu! Tang! Wu! Ta-a-ang!\n\n[Verse 6: Masta Killa]\nHomicide's illegal and death is the penalty\nWhat justifies the homicide when he dies in his own iniquity?\nIt's the master of the Mantis Rapture comin' at ya\nWe have an APB on an MC Killa!\nLooks like the work of a Masta\nEvidence indicates that his stature\nMerciless like a terrorist, hard to capture\nThe flow changes like a chameleon\nPlays like a friend and stabs you like a dagger\nThis technique attacks the immune system\nDisguised like a lie, paralysin' the victim\nYou scream as it enters your bloodstream\nErupts your brain from the pain these thoughts contain\nMovin' on a nigga with the speed of a centipede\nAnd injure any motherfuckin' contender!\n\n[Chorus: Method Man]\nMy peoples, are you with me? Where you at?!\nIn the front! In the back! Killa Beez on attack!\nMy peoples, are you with me? Where you at?!\nSmokin' meth, hittin' cats on the block with the gats!\n\n[Outro: \"Five Deadly Venoms\"]\nAnd immune to nearly any weapon\nWhen it's properly used, it's almost invincible\nToad style is immensely strong\nAnd immune to nearly any weapon\nWhen it's properly used, it's almost invincible\nWhen it's properly used85Embed"
