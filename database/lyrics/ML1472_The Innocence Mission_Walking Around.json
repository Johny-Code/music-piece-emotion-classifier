Now it can go\n\nSome boy I knew said, Hang on, stay gold\nBefore he left here for England\nBeautiful changes I feel sometimes\nIn the middle of the late morning dishes\nWhen You say I might do anything at all\nWalking around\nYou know I've had enough of this trouble\nFollowing me high and low. Now it can goYou might also likeEmbed"
