(You think you're above me!)\nBut now I'm here to envy\nFour words to choke upon!\nLook! (Look!)\nAt me, now!\n\n[Verse 2]\nBetrayed one more time\nBut somewhere down that line\nYou're gonna get what's coming to you\nLook at me now\nLook at me now\nLook at me now!\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nPull it out from my back\nSoon I'm the one that's on attack\nCan't wait to return the favour\nLook at me now\nLook at me now\nLook at me now!\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nToo many times I've seen it\nRip a hole into our friendship\nThis is how it's been\nHow it always will be\nYou think you're above me?
