How long must we sing this song?\nHow long? How long?\n'Cause tonight\nWe can be as one tonight\n[Verse 2]\nBroken bottles under children's feet\nBodies strewn across the dead end street\nBut I won't heed the battle call\nIt puts my back up, puts my back up against the wall\n\n[Chorus]\nSunday, Bloody Sunday\nSunday, Bloody Sunday\nSunday, Bloody Sunday\nSunday, Bloody Sunday\nOh, let's go\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd the battle's just begun\nThere's many lost, but tell me who has won?\nThe trench is dug within our hearts\nAnd mothers, children, brothers, sisters torn apart\n\n[Chorus]\nSunday, Bloody Sunday\nSunday, Bloody Sunday\n\n[Refrain]\nHow long? How long must we sing this song?\nHow long? How long?\n'Cause tonight\nWe can be as one tonight\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nSunday, Bloody Sunday (Tonight, tonight)\nSunday, Bloody Sunday (Tonight, tonight)\nCome get some\n\n[Bridge]\nWipe the tears from your eyes\nWipe your tears away\nI'll wipe your tears away\nI'll wipe your tears away\n\n[Chorus]\nSunday, Bloody Sunday (I'll wipe your bloodshot eyes)\nSunday, Bloody Sunday\nSunday, Bloody Sunday\nSunday, Bloody Sunday, oh\nSunday, Bloody Sunday\nSunday, Bloody Sunday, oh\nYeah, let's go\n\n[Verse 4]\nAnd it's true we are immune\nWhen fact is fiction and TV reality\nAnd today the millions cry (Sunday, Bloody Sunday)\nWe eat and drink while tomorrow they die (Sunday, Bloody Sunday)\nThe real battle just begun (Sunday, Bloody Sunday)\nTo claim the victory Jesus won (Sunday, Bloody Sunday) on\n[Chorus]\nSunday, Bloody Sunday, yeah, yeah\nSunday, Bloody Sunday27Embed"
