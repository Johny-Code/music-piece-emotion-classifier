        "lyrics": "Tetragrammaton Lyrics[Verse 1]\nTell me it's over, Rusbel awaits\nI've been to the surface and nothing is there\nEyelids sank muffled in the nerve aura sound\nBut when she awakes, will she still be with us?\nMy heart is darkclots, leap year is late\nHow did you get here? Ask all but the bait\nFrom a Christ that went hissing, constricting his cells\nWe summon by candle, by book and by bell\n\n[Chorus]\nGlossolalia coats my skin\nGlycerin and turbulence\nStuffed the voice inside of God\nMirrors to the animals\nGlossolalia coats my skin\nGlycerin and turbulence\n[Verse 2]\nThe sermon goes mourning pricking its hail\nSlothful the child that preys on the seed\nShall behead the drought, wound under sleeves\nI hope you have room in a thicket of vines\nGive me a moment to claim what you've stole\nThe streets will hang high stretched ribs and let taste\nWe'll cover the smell with silver nitrate\nMending the cuts of your prosthetic faith\n\n[Chorus]\nGlossolalia coats my skin\nGlycerin and turbulence\nStuffed the voice inside of God\nMirrors to the animals\nGlossolalia coats my skin\nGlycerin and turbulence\nStuffed the voice inside of God\nMirrors to the animals\n\n[Verse 3]\nThen so long, dear mnemonic\nAssume the form you've given me and I'll spill\nNow hold on, just hold my hand\nSay that they made you, but you brought your own leash\nTell me no more, no\nTell me no more, no\nYou might also like[Verse 4]\nOutside by the drift\nYou read my will of thread and itch\nFailure to comply as failure to decease\nAnd still you won't know everything\nI've built the fall\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Verse 5]\nThe sulking drained the fall of my pale will swarming by your steps\nLicking the ankles of your blasphemer guilts\nIt only meant to drape a plastic over the stuck pig scalp of head\nTo cover the sock where the flatline had spread\nThe kiosk in my temporal lobe is shaped like Rosalynn Carter\nShe says my map is home again but torn face down\nI have only but a million blemishes to tell you all about\n\n[Refrain]\nIn the end they just gagged me to make him come out\n\n[Verse 6]\nGas me the hind of your five legged snare\nTooth picks the eye, but nothing's there\nDown drags your waltz 'cross the altar top\nFrom a sleep that deprivation knew\nTrespass your form, I'm void of dusk\nI'd ask to look, but the mask stays on\nYou'll levitate teutonic print\nCruelty is the wrath of my instrument\n[Refrain]\nIn the end they just gagged me to make him come out\n\n[Verse 7]\nYou locked the cuffs, arsenic erupts\nWill you drink the shadow of my red hair?\nYou and your false witness to God\nYou've one in the chamber, but your finger got stuck\nLet slip the sound of a cry for help\nBut all was lost on the night you walked\nPalms speak through eyes, serve your memory lost\nI contaminate with insignias\n\n[Refrain]\nIn the end they just gagged me to make him come out\n\n[Chorus]\nGlossolalia coats my skin\nGlycerin and turbulence\nStuffed the voice inside of God\nMirrors to the animals\n\n[Bridge]\nWait 'til I get my hands on you\nI won't forget a face that lift me\nJust you wait 'til I get my hands on you\nI can't, oh, oh, oh\nYou won't remember\n\n[Verse 8]\nUnwrap my corpse and let it thaw\nIn the eye of the needle I can't get out\nThey'll check my wrist, I'll faint a pulse\nI'm not the human you thought I was\nIf you pet the night, sixth pentacle dice\nIf you roll the seven, St. Michael dies\nThey'll be no ransom, don't shut my mouth\nI scald the answer you're afraid of3Embed"
