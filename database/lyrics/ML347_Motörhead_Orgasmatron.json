        "lyrics": "Orgasmatron Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI am the one, orgasmatron, the outstretched grasping hand\nMy image is of agony, my servants rape the land\nObsequious and arrogant, clandestine and vain\nTwo thousand years of misery, of torture in my name\nHypocrisy made paramount, paranoia the law\nMy name is called religion: sadistic, sacred whore\n\n[Verse 2]\nI twist the truth, I rule the world, my crown is called deceit\nI am the emperor of lies, you grovel at my feet\nI rob you and I slaughter you, your downfall is my gain\nAnd still you play the sycophant and revel in your pain\nAnd all my promises are lies, all my love is hate\nI am the politician and I decide your fate\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI march before a martyred world, an army for the fight\nI speak of great heroic days, of victory and might\nI hold a banner drenched in blood, I urge you to be brave\nI lead you to your destiny, I lead you to your grave\nYour bones will build my palaces, your eyes will stud my crown\nFor I am Mars, the god of war, and I will cut you downYou might also like3Embed"
