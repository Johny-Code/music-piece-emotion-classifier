        "lyrics": "Celebration Of The Lizard LyricsLions in the street and roaming\nDogs in heat, rabid, foaming\nA beast caged in the heart of a city\nThe body of his mother\nRotting in the summer ground\nHe fled the town\nHe went down South and crossed the border\nLeft the chaos and disorder\nBack there over his shoulder\nOne morning he awoke in a green hotel\nWith a strange creature groaning beside him\nSweat oozed from its shining skin\nIs everybody in? Is everybody in?\nIs everybody in?\nThe ceremony is about to begin\nWake up!\nYou can't remember where it was\nHad this dream stopped?\nThe snake was pale gold, glazed and shrunken\nWe were afraid to touch it\nThe sheets were hot dead prisms\nAnd she was beside me\nOld, she's no, young\nHer dark red hair, the white soft skin\nNow, run to the mirror in the bathroom\nLook! she's coming in here\nI can't live through each slow century of her moving\nI let my cheek slide down, the cool smooth tile\nFeel the good cold stinging blood\nThe smooth hissing snakes of rain\nOnce I had a little game\nI liked to crawl back in my brain\nI think you know, the game I mean\nI mean the game, called, 'Go insane'\nYou should try this little game\nJust close your eyes forget your name\nForget the world, forget the people\nAnd we'll erect, a different steeple\nThis little game is fun to do\nJust close your eyes, no way to lose\nAnd I'm right there, I'm going too\nRelease control, we're breaking through\nWay back deep into the brain\nBack where there's never any pain\nAnd the rain falls gently on the town\nAnd over the heads of all of us\nAnd in the labyrinth of streams\nBeneath, the quiet unearthly presence of\nGentle hill dwellers, in the gentle hills around\nReptiles abounding\nFossils, caves, cool air heights\nEach house repeats a mold, windows rolled\nBeast car locked in against morning\nAll now sleeping\nRugs silent, mirrors vacant\nDust Lying under the beds of lawful couples\nWound in sheets\nAnd daughters, smug\nWith semen eyes in their nipples\nWait\nThere's been a slaughter here\nDon't stop to speak or look around\nYour gloves and fan are on the ground\nWe're getting out of town, we're going on the run\nAnd you're the one I want to come\nNot to touch the earth\nNot to see the sun\nNothing left to do, but\nRun, run, run\nLet's run, let's run\nHouse upon the hill, moon is lying still\nShadows of the trees\nWitnessing the wild breeze\nC'mon baby run with me\nLet's run\nRun with me\nRun with me\nRun with me\nLet's run\nThe mansion is warm at the top of the hill\nRich are the rooms and the comforts there\nRed are the arms of luxuriant chairs\nAnd you won't know a thing till you get inside\nDead President's corpse in the driver's car\nThe engine runs on glue and tar\nC'mon along, we're not going very far\nTo the East to meet the Czar\nRun with me\nRun with me\nRun with me\nLet's run\nSome outlaws lived by the side of the lake\nThe minister's daughter's in love with the snake\nWho lives in a well by the side of the road\nWake up, girl! We're almost home\nWe should see the gates by mornin'\nWe should be inside by evening\nSun, sun, sun\nBurn, burn, burn\nBurn, burn, burn\nI will get you\nSoon, soon, soon\nI am the lizard king\nI can do anything\nWe came down\nThe rivers and highways\nWe came down from\nForests and falls\nWe came down from\nCarson and Springfield\nWe came down from\nPhoenix enthralled\nAnd I can tell you\nThe names of the Kingdom\nI can tell you\nThe things that you know\nListening for a fistful of silence\nClimbing valleys into the shade\nFor seven years, I dwelt\nIn the loose palace of exile\nPlaying strange games with the girls of the island\nNow, I have come again\nTo the land of the fair and the strong and the wise\nBrothers and sisters of the pale forest\nChildren of night\nWho among you will run with the hunt?\nNow night arrives with her purple legion\nRetire now to your tents and to your dreams\nTomorrow we enter the town of my birth\nI want to be readyYou might also like3Embed"
