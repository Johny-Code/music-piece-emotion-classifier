My heart pounds my chest\nHeld for ransom in a spider's web\nSuffocating, no one hears my calls\nNever-ending, 'til the black curtain falls\nYou might also like[Instrumental Break]\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Verse 3]\nSnakes surround me\nOffering their death kiss to me\nDown, I'm drowning\nHow long? I hold my breath\nDogs are chasing\nMy legs are paralyzed\nPray, don't find me\nMy life is fading fast\n\n[Chorus]\nBlack curtains, never-ending\nBlack curtains fall\nBlack curtains, never-ending\nBlack curtains3Embed"
