We find the defendant guilty, on all counts, for crimes against all humanity.\"\n\"By virtue of the jury's decision and the power vested in me by the state, I hereby sentence you to be incarcerated with no possibility of parole... for life.\"\n\"Life?! What do you mean life?! I ain't got a life!\"\n\"Boy, your soul better belong to Jesus. Mhmm, 'cause your ass belongs to me, hahahahahahahaha!\"\n\n[Chorus]\nCaptive honour, ain't no honour\nCaptive honour, ain't no honour\n\n[Verse 1]\nNo time for questions, no time for games\nStart kicking ass and taking down the names\nA long shit list, a shorter fuse\nHe is untouchable, and guarantees you'll lose\n\n[Chorus]\nCaptive honour, ain't no honour\nCaptive honour, ain't no honour\n\n[Guitar Solo: Dave Mustaine]\n\n[Verse 2]\nInside the big house, his nightmare unfolds\nBefore he got there, his man-pussy was sold\nBlack blanket welcome, this tough guy's now a bitch\nPraying for death, it can't be worse than this!\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nCaptive honour, ain't no honour\nCaptive honour, ain't no honour\n\n[Guitar Solo: Dave Mustaine]\n\n[Guitar Solo: Marty Friedman]\n\n[Outro]\nCaptive honour, ain't no honour6Embed"
