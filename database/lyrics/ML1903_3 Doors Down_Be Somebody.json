I won't ever let you down\n[Verse 2]\nThe day has come\nThe sun is moving on\nShe don't know where he'll go\nOr when he's coming home\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nShe said, \"Son, take care, don't let your dreams get too far out of sight\"\nHe said, \"I love you. Now, don't worry about me, you know I'll be fine\"\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I'm trying to be somebody\nI'm not trying to be somebody else\nThis life is mine I'm living\nDon't you know me? I won't ever let you down\nNo\nI'm not trying to be somebody else\nDon't you know me? I won't ever let you\nI won't ever let you\n\n[Bridge]\nWhat they say\nWhat they know\nWhat they think won't ever bring me down\nThis life is mine\nAnd I am my own\nYou might also like[Interlude]\nI'm trying to be somebody\nI'm not trying to be somebody else\nThis life is mine I lead\nDon't you know me?\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm trying to be somebody\nI'm not trying to be somebody else\nThis life is mine I'm living\nDon't you know me? I won't ever let you down\n\n[Outro]\nI'm not trying to be somebody else\nDon't you know me? I won't ever let you down\nI won't be nobody else\nThis life is mine and I am my ownEmbed"
