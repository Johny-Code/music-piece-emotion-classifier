How did you get to this town?\n...Through this town?\nGonna walk right through this town again knowing that I'm only here tonight\nNever cared to stop and say hello;\nSo, tell me what they said because I don't have time to hang around in this town\nMaybe... maybe I should think to stay\nMaybe I won't ever return\nMaybe... maybe I should stop and play\nGonna walk right through this town again\nBut, all I know is I really should be on my way\nWouldn't mind one more night in townYou might also likeEmbed"
