Lee!\"\nNow, I don't mind chopping wood\nAnd I don't care if the money's no good\nYou take what you need\nAnd you leave the rest\nBut they should never\nHave taken the very best\nThe night they drove old Dixie down\nAnd the bells were ringing\nThe night they drove old Dixie down\nAnd all the people were singing\nThey went, \"Na, na, la, na, na, la\"\nLike my father before me\nI will work the land\nAnd like my brother above me\nWho took a rebel stand\nHe was just 18, proud and brave\nBut a Yankee laid him in his grave\nI swear by the mud below my feet\nYou can't raise a Kane back up\nWhen he's in defeat\nThe night they drove old Dixie down\nAnd the bells were ringing\nThe night they drove old Dixie down\nAnd all the people were singing\nThey went, \"Na, na, la, na, na, la\"\nThe night they drove old Dixie down\nAnd all the bells were ringing\nThe night they drove old Dixie down\nAnd the people were singing\nThey went, \"Na, na, la, na, na, la\"You might also likeEmbed"
