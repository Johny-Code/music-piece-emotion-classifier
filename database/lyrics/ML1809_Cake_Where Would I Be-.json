Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI've been waiting for so long\nI've been hoping your love's not gone\nHouses are sliding in the mud\nRivers are raging in your blood\n\n[Chorus]\nWhere would I be without your love?\nWhere would I be without your arms around me?\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou want to be the only one\nIf I knew you I would not run\nYou have been cloudy, distant, dark\nI'm thinking of Noah and the ark\n[Chorus] [x2]You might also like1Embed"
