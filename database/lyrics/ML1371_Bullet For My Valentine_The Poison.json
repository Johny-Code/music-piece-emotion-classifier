(We go?)\nShe'll never know!\n[Chorus]\nHolding on to you, to keep from falling\nYour eyes are closing now\nAnother chapter's ending\n\n[Verse 2]\nHard times, we always saw!\nThere's nothing left of you no more\nFear has no place, no place!\nCover her face!\n\n[Chorus]\nHolding on to you, to keep from falling\nYour eyes are closing now\nAnother chapter's ending\n\nThis is our last goodbye (goodbye!)\nThis is our time tonight\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Bridge]\nHolding on to you!\nCover up her face!\n\nHolding on to you, to keep from falling!\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nHolding on to you, to keep from falling\nYour eyes are closing now\nAnother chapter's ending\n\n[Outro]\nThis is our last goodbye (goodbye!)\nThis is our time tonight (goodbye!)\nThis is our last goodbye!Embed"
