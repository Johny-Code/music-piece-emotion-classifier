I'm glad that you are here\nI got to start to thinking, and seeing things so clear\n'Cause now how could I forget what she left?\nWhat happened in November is what  needed\nAnd I'm sorry that it shows, but life ain't so bad you know?\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd now the sky's such a sweet blue\nAnd you made this come true\nAnd my heart feels so new\n(woah-oh, woah-oh, woah, woah, woah-oh)\nIt's now wonderful to see beautiful views\nLike skies that are so blue\n(woah-oh, woah-oh, woah, woah, woah-oh)\nWoah, woah\nI'll never leave this you know\n[Verse 2]\nI'd turn it off for this\nIt looks like we got what we wished\nIt snowed in Texas but you missed (first time since '86)\nAnd I can't stop thinking how wonderful this is\nAnd I'm sorry I sound glad, but why always be so sad?\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd now the sky's such a sweet blue\nAnd you made this come true\nAnd my heart feels so new\n(woah-oh, woah-oh, woah, woah, woah-oh)\nIt's now wonderful to see beautiful views\nLike skies that are so blue\n(woah-oh, woah-oh, woah, woah, woah-oh)\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd I know that sometimes oh I might feel alone\nSo broke, and cold\nBut now I'll show that I know\n\n[Chorus]\nThat the sky's such a sweet blue\nAnd you made this come true\nAnd my heart feels so new\n(woah-oh, woah-oh, woah, woah, woah-oh)\nIt's now wonderful to see beautiful views\nLike skies that are so blue\n(woah-oh, woah-oh, woah, woah, woah-oh)\nWoah, woah\nI'll never leave this you know\nWoah, woah, woah\nWoah-oh, woah, woah, woah\nWoah-oh, woah, woah, woahYou might also likeEmbed"
