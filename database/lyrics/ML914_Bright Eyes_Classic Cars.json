        "lyrics": "Classic Cars LyricsShe was a real royal lady, true patron of the arts\nShe said the best country singers die in the back of classic cars\nSo if I ever got too hungry for a suitcase or guitar\nTo think of them all alone in the dark\nSo I laid some nights beside her in a bed made for a queen\nShe said I kissed her different, that all the men her age were mean\nGave me anything I wanted, oh the generosity\nI took all that I could, it was free\n\nNow the sky's a torn-up denim and the clouds are just splattered paint\nIt's a room I'm renovating; it's a name I got to change\nIf I get out of California, I'm going back to my home state\nTo tell them all that I made a mistake\nAnd I keep looking for that blindfold faith\nLighting candles to a cynical saint\nWho wants the last laugh at the fly trapped in the windowsill tape\nYou can go right out of your mind trying to escape\nFrom the panicked paradox of day to day\nIf you can't understand something then it's best to be afraid\nThe whole world it loves you if you're a chic chameleon\nIntersecting circles, she could hang with anyone\nBut when conducting business she would lie about where she's from\nSaying, \"Life is how it is not how it was\"\n\nI learned to listen, felt like I was back at school\nShe'd talk forever about the phases of the moon\nSaying, \"Everything is a cycle, you've got to let it come to you\nAnd when it does, you will know what to do\"\n\nWithout even knowing, I guess I took up her advice\nPainted her front door, it seemed a suitable goodbye\nIt's not that often but I think of her sometimes\nJust something quaint, a couple ships in the night\n\nAnd they keep moving at a glacial pace\nTurning circles in a memory maze\nI made a new cast of the death mask that's gonna cover my face\nI had to change the combination to the safe\nHide it all behind a wall, let people wait\nAnd never trust a heart that's so bent it can't breakYou might also like1Embed"
