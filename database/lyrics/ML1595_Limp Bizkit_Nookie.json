I'm like a chump\n(Hey!) Like a chump\n(Hey!) Like a chump\n(Hey!) I'm like a chump\n(Hey!) Like a chump\n(Hey!) Like a chump\n(Hey!)\n\n[Verse 2]\nShould I be feelin' bad? (No!) Should I be feelin' good? (No!)\nIt's kinda sad, I'm the laughin' stock of the neighborhood\nAnd you would think that I'd be movin' on (Move it!)\nBut I'm a sucker, like I said, fucked up in the head, not!\nAnd maybe, she just made a mistake\nAnd I should give her a break, my heart'll ache either way\nHey, what the hell, what you want me to say?\nI won't lie, that I can't deny\n\n[Chorus]\nI did it all for the nookie (Come on!)\nThe nookie (Come on!)\nSo you can take that cookie\nAnd stick it up your (Yeah!)\nStick it up your (Yeah!)\nStick it up your (Yeah!)\nStick it up your\u2026\nI did it all for the nookie (Come on!)\nThe nookie (Come on!)\nSo you can take that cookie\nAnd stick it up your (Yeah!)\nStick it up your (Yeah!)\nStick it up your (Yeah!)\nStick it up your\u2026\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nWhy did it take so long?\nWhy, did I wait so long, huh?\nTo figure it out, but I did it\nAnd I'm the only one underneath the sun who didn't get it\nI can't believe that I could be deceived (But you were!)\nBy my so-called girl, but in reality\nHad a hidden agenda\nShe put my tender heart in a blender, and still, I surrendered\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\n(Hey!) Like a chump\n(Hey!) I'm like a chump\n(Hey!) Like a chump\n(Hey!) Like a chump\n(Hey!) I'm like a chump\n(Hey!) Like a chump\n(Hey!) Like a chump\n\n[Chorus]\nI did it all for the nookie (Come on!)\nThe nookie (Come on!)\nSo you can take that cookie\nAnd stick it up your (Yeah!)\nStick it up your (Yeah!)\nStick it up your (Yeah!)\nStick it up your\u2026\nI did it all for the nookie (Come on!)\nThe nookie (Come on!)\nSo you can take that cookie\nAnd stick it up your (Yeah!)\nStick it up your (Yeah!)\nStick it up your (Yeah!)\nStick it up your\u2026\n[Bridge]\nI'm only human\nIt's so easy for your friends to give you their advice\nThey'll tell you, \"Just let it go!\"\nIt's easier said than done\nI appreciate it, I do, but\nJust leave me alone, leave me alone\nJust leave me alone\nAnd nothing gonna change, you can go away\nI'm just gonna stay here and always be the same\nAnd nothing gonna change, so you can go away\nAnd I'm just gonna stay here and always be the same\nAnd nothing gonna change, so you can go away\nAnd I'm just gonna stay here and always be the same\n\n[Chorus]\nI did it all for the nookie (Come on!)\nThe nookie (Come on!)\nSo you can take that cookie\nAnd stick it up your (Yeah!)\nStick it up your (Yeah!)\nStick it up your (Yeah!)\nStick it up your\u2026\nI did it all for the nookie (Come on!)\nThe nookie (Come on!)\nSo you can take that cookie\nAnd stick it up your (Yeah!)\nStick it up your (Yeah!)\nStick it up your (Yeah!)\nStick it up your\u202614Embed"
