A drive-by in Missouri\nThem fools got popped\nTook they corner next day, set up shop\nAnd it's better than slangin' in the Valley\nTriple the profit makin' more than I did in Cali\nBreakin' off rocks like Barney Rubble\n'Cause them mark-ass niggas don't want trouble\nAnd we ain't on edge when we do work\nPolice don't recognize the khakis and the sweatshirts\nGettin' bitches and they can't stand a\n1991 Tony Montana\nNow the shit's like a war\nOf gang violence, where it was never seen before\nPunks run when the gat bust\nFour Jheri curl niggas kickin' up dust\nAnd some of them are even lookin' up to us\nWearing our colors and talkin' that gang fuss\nGivin' up much love\nDyin' for a street that they never heard of\nBut other motherfuckers wanna stand strong\nSo you know the phrase, once again it's on\nYou might also like[Interlude]\nAt the top of the news tonight, gangs from South Central, Los Angeles which are known for their drive-by shootings\nHave migrated into East St. Louis, leaving three dead and two others injured\nNo arrests have been made\nPolice say this is a nationwide trend\nWith similar incidents occurring in Texas, Michigan, and Oklahoma\n\n[Verse 3]\nBoom, my homie got shot, he's a goner, black\nSt. Louis niggas want they corner back\nShootin' in snowy weather\nIt's illegal business, niggas still can't stick together\nFuckin' police got the 4-1-1\nThat L.A. ain't all surf and sun\nBut we ain't thinkin' 'bout the boys\nFeudin' like the Hatfields and McCoys\nNow the shit's gettin' tricky\n'Cause now they lookin' for the colors and the Dickies\nDamn, the spot's gettin' hot from the battle\nAbout to pack up and start slangin' in Seattle\nBut the NARCs raid about six in the mornin'\nTry to catch a nigga when he's yawnin'\nPut his Glock to my chest as I pause\nWent to jail in my motherfuckin' drawers\nTryna give me fifty-seven years\nFace'll be full of those tattooed tears\nIt's the same old story and the same old nigga stuck\nAnd the public defender ain't givin' a fuck\nThe fool must be sparkin'\nTalkin' about a double life plea bargain\nYou got to deal with the Crips and the Bloods by hand, G\nPlus the Black Guerilla family\nAnd the white pride don't like no side\nAnd it's a riot if any one of us die\nNo parole or probation\nNow this is a young man's summer vacation\nNo chance for rehabilitation\n'Cause look at the motherfuckin' years that I'm facin'\nI'ma end it like this 'cause you know what's up\nMy life is fucked\n[Outro]\nCome on, G\nPolice, eat a dick, straight up\nLook here, you lil' goddamn nigga, you're not gafflin' nobody\nYou fuckin' understand me? (Kick his ass, put him down)\nThat's right, get down on the goddamn ground now\nFuckin' move, now (Let me take a shot at him, let me take a shot him)\nWe're gonna do you like King\nWhat goddamn King?\nRodney King, Martin Luther King, and all the goddamn Kings from Africa\nLook out, motherfucker8Embed"
