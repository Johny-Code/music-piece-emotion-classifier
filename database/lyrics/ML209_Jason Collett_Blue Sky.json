You've missed so much\n[Chorus]\nBring on the blue sky\nBring on blue sky\nBring on the blue sky\nBring on blue sky\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou can fly in your dreams\nFloating by the black and white scenery\nTake a drive where lovers leap\nOnly to arrive dead on your feet\n\n[Chorus]\nBring on the blue sky\nBring on blue sky\nBring on the blue sky\nBring on blue sky\n\n[Verse 3]\nOh, this stiff heart of mine (Stiff heart of mine)\nIf ever there was a time (There was a time)\nOnly you must leave these things behind\nThe paint is peeling off\nThe hood of this old truck\nAs you drive into the West\nWhere the eye of God is sinking fast\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nBring on the blue sky\nBring on blue sky\nBring on the blue sky\nBring on blue sky\nBring on the blue sky\nBring on the blue sky\nBring on the blue sky\nBring on blue skyEmbed"
