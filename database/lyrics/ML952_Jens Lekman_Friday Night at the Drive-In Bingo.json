        "lyrics": "Friday Night at the Drive-In Bingo Lyrics[Verse 1]\nIn a tiny, tiny southern Swedish country town\nTwo acres of field and a gas station\nRiding on my moped, looking for fun\nStaring into the blood red sun\nOn the country road is a boulevard\nWith neon lights and night open bars\nIn my jacket a pack of playing cards\nJust jacks, jokers, and the queen of hearts\n\n[Chorus]\nMy heart is beating\nBeating like Ringo\nAs I pull into the drive-in bingo\n[Verse 2]\nWhy do the people in the country want to look like the people in the city\nWhen the people in the city aren't the slightest pretty?\nI want the people in the country to wear flannel shirts and saggy jeans all covered in dirt\nI want the people in the country to be open and kind\nBut most times I've met those with a narrow mind\nWith a big black dog to bite your behind\nIf they ever find out you're not one of their kind\n\n[Chorus]\nAll these thoughts as I open up a Zingo\nFriday night at the drive-in bingo\n\n[Bridge]\nSo this is what they do out here for fun?\nThey play bingo and let their engines run?\nTonight's jackpot is a pig, hey that's criminal!\nG-42! Ooh, I'm going diagonal!\nI'm gonna gather up a few of my friends\nAs many fits into an army tent\nJust bring our savings and a bottle of wine\nTo the Friday night's reversal of time!\n\n[Verse 3]\nThis little south-west village shouldn't cost that much\nMaybe a handful of silver or a hundred bucks\nWe could have wild, wild parties in that big old lodge\nAnd the windmill's perfect for movies and such\nWe could fake our deaths to get insurance money\nAnd take on hippie names, I'd be Snowphish, you'd be Sunny\nWe could start a little farm with little white bunnies\nJust because watching them copulate is very funny\nThere's a cow and an ostrich just waiting for you!\nA glass of apple cider just waiting for you!\nThe smell of 1952 just waiting for you!\nAnd all I'm doing here is just waiting for you...\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nA daydream, I'm caught up in limbo\nFriday night at the drive-in bingoEmbed"
