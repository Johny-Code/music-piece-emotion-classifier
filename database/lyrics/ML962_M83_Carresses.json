But it will be best for you to stay here tonight\nCome now my good man, you can't frighten us. We've been over your foul roads before\nPlease, you do not understand. It is not the roads, it is the darkness! Here our doors are protected with bat thorns\nWhat is all this bat thorn business?\nIt keeps them out. They're afraid of it, the demons of the castle\nGood evening. It's a lovely even-- [cough] --ning\nWell Doctor, for one who is not afraid of the dark, you have been pushing your horse pretty fast\nWell, you know horses - once they get started for home there is no stopping them\n\nOh, I admit, I was a bit impatient... I mean, hungry for one of your wonderful meals\nYes. The vampires are hungry too for theirs\n\n*Nervous laughter*\nNonsense. Rubbish. Vampires. Nonsense. I won't keep you waiting. I'll be right out for my supper\n\n[Instrumental]You might also likeEmbed"
