My old man's a dustman\nHe wears a dustman's hat\nHe wears cor-blimey trousers\nAnd he lives in a council flat\n\nLonnie: I say, I say, I say!\nLes: Huh?\nLonnie: My dustbin's full of lilies\nLes: Well throw 'em away then!\nLonnie: I can't: Lily's wearing them\n\nNow one day whilst in a hurry\nHe missed a lady's bin\nHe hadn't gone but a few yards\nWhen she chased after him\n\"What game do you think you're playing?\"\nShe cried right from the 'eart\n\"You've missed me, am I too late?\"\n\"No, jump up on the cart!\"\n\nOi! My old man's a dustman\nHe wears a dustman's hat\nHe wears cor-blimey trousers\nAnd he lives in a council flat\n\nLonnie: I say, I say, I say!\nLes: Not you again!\nLonnie: My dustbin's absolutely full with toadstools\nLes: How do you know it's full?\nLonnie: 'Cause there's not mushroom inside\n\nHe found a tiger's head one day\nNailed to a piece of wood\nThe tiger looked like miserable\nBut I suppose he should\n\nJust then from out a window\nA voice began to wail\nIt said \"Oi! Where's me tiger's head?\"\n\"Four foot from his tail.\"\n\nOh my old man's a dustman\nHe wears a dustman's hat\nHe wears cor-blimey trousers\nAnd he lives in a council flat\n\nNext time you see a dustman\nLooking all pale and sad\nDon't kick him in the dustbin\nIt might be my old dadEmbed"
