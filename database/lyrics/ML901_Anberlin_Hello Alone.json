Hello, hello\nBroken hearts like promises\nAre left for lesser knowns\nIs anybody out there? Alone, Alone\nBecause the coldest winters thrive\n\n[Verse 2]\nDepression is the unholy ghost\nIn the coastal town ahead\nThough I know a thousand names\nI seem my only friend\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI've got the gun, all I need is ten cents for the bullet\nI feel helpless, sleeping at best. Waiting for your return\nAre you ever coming home?\n\n[Chorus]\nIs anybody out there? Hello, hello\nBroken hearts like promises are left for lesser knowns\nIs anybody out there? Alone, alone\nBecause the coldest winters thrive on broken homes. (Broken Homes)\n\n[Bridge]\nDoes anybody, (does anybody)\nDo they ever listen, (Do they ever listen)\nDoes anybody, (does anybody)\nCare at all?\nDo they care at all? Do they care at all?\nDo they care at all? Do you care at all?\nDo you care at all!?\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nIs this the end of everything we know?\nThis is the end of everything I am\n\n[Chorus]\nIs anybody out there? Hello, hello\nBroken hearts like promises are left for lesser knowns\nIs anybody out there? Alone alone\nBecause the coldest winters thrive on broken homes\nIs anybody out there? Hello, hello\nBroken hearts like promises are left for lesser knowns\nIs anybody out there? Alone alone\nFor lesser known\nI'm here and there's hope. There's hopeEmbed"
