Tonight\nThey'll kill and demonstrate what fight is all about\nInside I'm wandering, wandering\n\"What you're doing\nWhat you do has the logic of a soldier\nAnd people will curse you\"\nBlood and ruins, blood and ruins\nOur fragile conscience lies awaiting for a war\nWhere liars and honest people fight to get some money\nInside I'm wandering, wandering\n\"What you're doing\nWhat you do has the logic of a soldier\nAnd people will curse you\"\nBlood and ruins, blood and ruins\nInside I'm wandering, wandering\n\"What you're doing\nWhat you do has no meaning\nConsider the fight's all around\"\nInside I'm wandering, inside I'm wandering...You might also likeEmbed"
