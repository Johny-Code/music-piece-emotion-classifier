Let's get known!\nIf we work real hard, we can buy some matching clothes\nFor our live shows\nLook at the ants on the floor\nThey work real hard, lifting three times their mass\nAnd sometimes more\n\nSo what do you say?\nLet's get known\nLet's have two spotlights shining\nWith all our work shown\n\nWhat do you say? It's all on the lineYou might also likeEmbed"
