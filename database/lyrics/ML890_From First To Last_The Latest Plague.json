I heard a\nSick sad voice, it was\nHonesty, I turned to her and said\n\u201cWe need to be medicated\nAnd you're the prescription\nFor a forced out vision\nIf you're with me, send the\nCritics to hell with the sounds of our voices\u201d\n\n[Chorus]\nFake faces everywhere I see\nFake people looking back at me\nSit down, don't tell me\nDon't tell me where I don't belong\nFake faces everywhere I see\nFake people looking back at me\nSit down, don't tell me\nWhere I don't belong\n\n[Bridge]\nAll you better-thans that fed us shit\nYou'll be\nKnocked on the floor, so\nDon't you place your bets just yet\nAll you treasure sleepers feed on shit\nYou'll be\nKnocked on the floor, so\nDon't you place!\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nFake faces everywhere I see\nFake people looking back at me\nSit down, don't tell me\nDon't tell me where I don't belong\nFake faces everywhere I see\nFake people looking back at me\nSit down, don't tell me\nWhere I don't belongEmbed"
