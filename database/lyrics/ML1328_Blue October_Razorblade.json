        "lyrics": "Razorblade LyricsIn the day by day collision\nCalled the art of growing up\nThere's an innocence we look for in the stars\nTo be taken back to younger days\nWhen there was no giving up\nOn the people we held closest to our hearts\n\nYeah, it is you that I remember in that glowing\nIt is you that took my first away from me\nIt is you I set my standards to, to every walk of life\nI haven't met another you since you were with me\n[Chorus]\nA brief bout with a razorblade cut me\nI freaked out, thinking people didn't love me\nI watched closely as the you I knew forgot me\nIn letting go, I am so proud of what I've done\n\nIn a way, I failed religion\nI spit the wine from mouth to cup\nAnd I reached for something more than just your God\nUncle, you spared not your children\nAnd while your praying hands are up\nThere's no forgiveness for you! You sick fuck!\n\nIt is you that I remember in their bedroom\nIt is you that took their first away from them\nIt is you they set their standards to\nYou wounded them for life\nYou were a preacher and suppose to be above men\n\nSing with me\n\n[Chorus]\nA brief bout with a razorblade cut me\nI freaked out, thinking people didn't love me\nI watched closely as the you I knew forgot me\nIn letting go, I am so proud of what I've doneYou might also likeEmbed"
