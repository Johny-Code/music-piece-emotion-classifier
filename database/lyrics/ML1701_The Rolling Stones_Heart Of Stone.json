I don't really know\nNo matter how I try, I just can't make her cry\n'Cause she'll never break, never break, never break, never break\nThis heart of stone\nOh, no, no, no, this heart of stone\n[Verse 3]\nDon't keep on looking that same old way\nIf you try acting sad, you will only make me glad\nBetter listen little girl, you go on walking down the street\nI ain't got no love, I ain't the kind to meet\n'Cause she'll never break, never break, never break, never break\nThis heart of stone\nOh, no, no, no, this heart of stone\n\n[Outro]\nOh, no, no, no\nYou'll never break this heart of stone, darling\nNo, no, this heart of stone\nYou'll never break it, darling\nYou won't break this heart of stone\nOh, no, no, no\nYou better go, you better go home\n'Cause you'll, you'll never break this heart of stone\nYou better, you better drive on homeYou might also like1Embed"
