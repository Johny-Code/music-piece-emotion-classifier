        "lyrics": "Dune Sea LyricsChairs on an island, candles in a room\nHe showed her all the things that made a new day new\nShe kept forgetting but he would help recall\nThere's more to life than standing when the world wants you to fall\n\nSo she needs him badly and now she thinks she's lost\nWithout the strength he lent, the pillar and the cross\nLies on an island, sleeps in a room\nThere's no more need for standing when the world won't let you fall\n\nIt's wilderness in here, a dune sea stretched for miles\nCan't you come home?\nIt's wilderness in here, a dune sea stretched for miles\nCan't you come home?\nYou made this too\nYou made this too\nYou made this for me alone\nYou made this too\nYou made this too\nI made you do this to me\n\nIt's wilderness in here, a dune sea stretched for miles\nCan't you come home?\nIt's wilderness in here, a dune sea stretched for miles\nCan't you come home?You might also likeEmbed"
