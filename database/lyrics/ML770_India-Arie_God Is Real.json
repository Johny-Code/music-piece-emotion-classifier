It literally changed\nMy life\nFor the first time I understood its power\nAs I swam I was cleansed\nIf I had any doubts\nThis experience cleared them\nNow I know for sure that GOd is real\nI know that it's the truth\nBy the way it feels\nYou might also likeCause I saw starfish and sponges\nFish shaped like trumpets\nSo many different colors\nI stayed out there for hours and I only saw a fraction of a fraction of the\nDeepest of the deep of the great blue wide\nIt brought a tear to my eye\n\nChorus\nThat's how I know that God is real\nAll of this is not by chance\nThat's how I know that God is real\nAll of this is not by chance\nThat's how I know that God is real\nI know this is not by chance\nThat's how I know that God is real\n\nWe're made of the same stuff\nAs the moon and the stars\nThe oceans saltwater just like my tears are\nYou feel me\nThe sunrises and sets everyday without fail\n\nChorus\nThat's how I know that God is real\nAll of this is not by chance\nThat's how I know that God is real\nAll of this is not by chance\nThat's how I know that God is real\nI know this is not by chance\nThat's how I know that God is realEmbed"
