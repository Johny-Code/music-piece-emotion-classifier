F to the A-B\nBlack Buddafly, let's go\n\nAnd I'm a bad boy like Martin and Will\nShow you what you been missin, like the kids on a carton of milk\nHey, I can snatch somethin bad out of the hood\nAnd bring 'em back to the pad out by the woods\nYou know the crew bring the bad out of the good\nAnd I'm usually not layin in the boozy spots\nGirl we can blow quicker than uzi shots\nChill where the Cristal's cold, jacuzzi's hot, ya feel?\n[Black Buddafly]\nI ain't really the kind of girl that, who would\nSay that I'm a bad girl, though I should\nSo many times I did what I thought was, right\nBut ended up in pain and that's why I'm like this\nI still believe and I'm hopin\nThat I will find real love\nBut right now it's not the time for, that\nCause I'm young and I'm bad and I like, that\n\n[Hook: Black Buddafly]\nOhhhhhhhh, do you feel me now?\nOhhhhhhhh, do you tell me now?\nOhhhhhhhh, ladies help me out\nOhhhhhhhh, what...\n\n[Chorus: Black Buddafly]\nEy! If you feel me, move with me, and don't stop\nPut your hands up, soon as the beat drops\nCause usually I'm not like this\nBut tonight I'm a baaaaaaad girl\nI'm a baaaaaaad girl\nAnd tonight we gonna show you how we get down\n\n[Black Buddafly]\nDon't think I'm inno-cent\nMight look like that outside but, when\nI be alone with you, you'll see different\n'Cause all the boys dig those crazy, things\nI like it so good and so deep\nLike I said, the bitch tried to sleep\nDon't get me wrong because I'm not a, ho\nI tell you where to step and when to, go\nYou might also like[Hook: Black Buddafly]\nOhhhhhhhh, do you feel me now?\nOhhhhhhhh, do you tell me now?\nOhhhhhhhh, ladies help me out\nOhhhhhhhh, what...\n\n[Chorus (2x): Black Buddafly]\nEy! If you feel me, move with me, and don't stop\nPut your hands up, soon as the beat drops\nCause usually I'm not like this\nBut tonight I'm a baaaaaaad girl\nI'm a baaaaaaad girl\nAnd tonight we gonna show you how we get down\n\n[Fabolous]\nOnce a good girl's gone bad, she's gone forever\nProbably with me, enjoyin California weather\nHey mami we belong together, like the white & yellow\nStones that's set into the prong together\nAnd now a girl get into a stressed out mood\nAnd go bad faster than left out food\nThey say it's the lazy flow the shorties love\nIt drive 'em crazy though like Courtney Love\nI keep a bad one that's also a good cook\nFifth Ave classy mixed with the hood look\nAnd my good looks dem bad for your health\nAnd e'rybody know you can do bad by yourself, girl\n[Chorus: Black Buddafly]\nEy! If you feel me, move with me, and don't stop\nPut your hands up, soon as the beat drops\nCause usually I'm not like this\nBut tonight I'm a baaaaaaad girl\nI'm a baaaaaaad girl\nAnd tonight we gonna show you how we get down\n\n[Black Buddafly]\nDo you feel me now?\nDo you tell me now?\nLadies help me out\nWhat...Embed"
