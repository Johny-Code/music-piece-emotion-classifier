I ask in all honesty\nWhat would life be?\nWithout a song or a dance, what are we?\nSo I say thank you for the music, for giving it to me\n[Verse 2]\nMother says I was a dancer before I could walk\nMhm, she says I began to sing long before I could talk\nAnd I've often wondered, how did it all start?\nWho found out that nothing can capture a heart\nLike a melody can?\nWell, whoever it was, I'm a fan\n\n[Chorus]\nSo I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing\nThanks for all the joy they're bringing\nWho can live without it? I ask in all honesty\nWhat would life be?\nWithout a song or a dance, what are we?\nSo I say thank you for the music, for giving it to me\n\n[Bridge]\nI've been so lucky\nI am the girl with golden hair\nI wanna sing it out to everybody\nWhat a joy, what a life, what a chance\n\n[Chorus]\nThank you for the music, the songs I'm singing\nThanks for all the joy they're bringing\nWho can live without it? I ask in all honesty\nWhat would life be?\nWithout a song or a dance, what are we?\nSo I say thank you for the music, for giving it to me\nYou might also like[Outro]\nSo I say thank you for the music, for giving it to me7Embed"
