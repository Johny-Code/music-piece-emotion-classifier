Does she talk?\nDoes she come complete?\nMy homeroom homeroom angel\nAlways pulled me from my seat\nShe was pure like snowflakes\nNo one could ever stain\nThe memory of my angel\nCould never cause me pain\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nYears go by\nI'm looking through a girly magazine\nAnd there's my homeroom angel\nOn the pages in-between\n\n[Chorus]\nMy blood runs cold\nMy memory has just been sold\nMy angel is the centerfold\nAngel is the centerfold\nMy blood runs cold (Woo!)\nMy memory has just been sold\nAngel is the centerfold\n\n[Verse 2]\nSlipped me notes under the desk\nWhile I was thinking about her dress\nI was shy, I turned away\nBefore she caught my eye\nI was shaking in my shoes\nWhenever she flashed those baby-blues\nSomething had a hold on me\nWhen angel passed close by\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nThose soft and fuzzy sweaters\nToo magical to touch\nTo see her in that n\u00e9glig\u00e9e\nIs really just too much\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nMy blood runs cold (Yeah)\nMy memory has just been sold\nMy angel is the centerfold\nAngel is the centerfold\nMy blood runs cold\nMy memory has just been sold (Oh yeah)\nAngel is the centerfold\n\n[Bridge]\nNa-na, na-na-na-na\nNa-na-na, na-na-na-na\nNa-na, na-na-na-na\nNa-na-na, na-na-na-na\nNa-na, na-na-na-na\nNa-na-na, na-na-na-na\nNa-na, na-na-na-na\nNa-na-na, na-na-na-na\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow, look\nIt's okay, I understand\nThis ain't no never-never land\nI hope that when this issue's gone\nI'll see you when your clothes are on\nTake your car, yes, we will\nWe'll take your car and drive it\nWe'll take it to a motel room\nAnd take 'em off in private\n[Pre-Chorus 3]\nA part of me has just been ripped\nThe pages from my mind are stripped\nOh no, I can't deny it\nOh yeah, I guess I gotta buy it\n\n[Chorus]\nMy blood runs cold\nMy memory has just been sold\nMy angel is the centerfold\nAngel is the centerfold\nMy blood runs cold (Woo!)\nMy memory has just been sold\nMy angel is the centerfold\n\n[Bridge/Outro]\nNa-na, na-na-na-na\nNa-na-na, na-na-na-na\n(Alright! Alright! 1, 2, 3, 4!)\nNa-na, na-na-na-na\nNa-na-na, na-na-na-na\nNa-na, na-na-na-na\nNa-na-na, na-na-na-na\nNa-na, na-na-na-na\nNa-na-na, na-na-na-na\nNa-na, na-na-na-na\nNa-na-na, na-na-na-na\nMy blood runs cold (Na-na, na-na-na-na)\nMy memory has just been sold (Na-na-na, na-na-na-na)\nMy angel is the centerfold (Na-na, na-na-na-na)\nAngel is the centerfold (Na-na-na, na-na-na-na)\nMy blood runs cold (Oh yeah) (Na-na, na-na-na-na)\nMy memory has just been sold (Na-na-na, na-na-na-na)\nMy angel is the centerfold (Na-na, na-na-na-na)\nAngel is the centerfold (Na-na-na, na-na-na-na)\n(Na-na, na-na-na-na)\n(Na-na-na, na-na-na-na)6Embed"
