What's happening my man?\n[Verse 3]\nAre they still getting down where we used to go and dance?\nWill our ball club win the pennant, do you think they have a chance?\nAnd tell me friend, how in the world have you been?\nTell me what's out and I want to know what's in\n\n[Verse 4]\nWhat's the deal man\nWhat's happening? What's happening brother?\nWhat's happening brother?\nAh, what's happening brother?\nWhat's happening my man?\nWhoo, ah, ah, what's happening brother?\nSay man, whoo, what's happening brother?\n\n[Outro]\nWhat's been shaking up and down the line?\nI want to know, because I'm slightly behind the timesYou might also like5Embed"
