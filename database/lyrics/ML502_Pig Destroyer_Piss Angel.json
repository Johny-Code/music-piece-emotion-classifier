Her partner laid motionless beneath her, seemingly dead. Her eye sockets dry and empty, her heels and elbows scraped and bloodied. Some on-lookers gasped in horror, some swooned and fainted melodramatically, most just stared in disbelief. Jennifer reached down between her thighs and pulled the crotch of her bathing suit to the side - exposing her vagina. The other girl slowly sat up and began sliding her fingers into Jennifer. A few minutes later, her wrists were in, then her elbows. Eventually she would completely disappear into her womb. Jennifer tilted her head to the side curiously. She heard the sound of a rickety-wooden roller-coaster in the distance, its passengers screaming in mock terror. She knew that, sooner or later, they would realize that the ride wasn't stopping and they were all going to dieYou might also like1Embed"
