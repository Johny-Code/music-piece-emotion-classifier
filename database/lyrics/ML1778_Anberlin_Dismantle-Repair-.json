Lyrics[Verse 1]\nOne last glance from a taxi cab\nImages scar my mind\nFour weeks've felt like years\nSince your full attention was all mine\nThe night was young and so were we\nTalked about life, God, death, and your family\nDidn't want any promises\nJust my undivided honesty\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd you said\n\"Oh, oh, things are gonna change now for the better (and)\"\n\"Oh, oh, things are gonna change. Oh, they're gonna change\"\n[Verse 2]\nI am the patron saint of lost causes\nA fraction of who I once believed\n(Change)\nOnly a matter of time\nOpinions I will try and rewrite\nIf life had background music\nPlaying your song\nI've got to be honest - I tried to escape you\nBut the orchestra plays on\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd they sing\n\"Oh, oh, things are gonna change now for the better (and)\"\n\"Oh, oh, things are gonna change\"\n\n[Chorus]\nHands like secrets are the hardest thing to keep from you\nLines and phrases like knives your words can cut me through\nDismantle me down, (Repair) you dismantle me, you dismantle me\nHands like secrets are the hardest thing to keep from you\nLines and phrases like knives your words can cut me through\nDismantle me down, (Repair) you dismantle me, you dismantle me\n\n[Verse 3]\nGive me time to prove\nTo prove I want the rest of yours (Prelude)\nCall this a prelude to a lifetime of you\nIt's not that I hang on every word\nI hang myself on what you repeat\nIts not that I keep hanging on\nI'm never letting go\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nHands like secrets are the hardest things to keep from you\nLines and phrases like knives your words can cut me through\nDismantle me down, (Repair) you dismantle me, you dismantle me\nHands like secrets are the hardest things to keep from you\nLines and phrases like knives your words can cut me through\nDismantle me down, (Repair) you dismantle me, you dismantle me\n\n[Bridge]\nSave me from myself\nSave me from myself\nHelp me\nSave me from myself\nSave me from myself\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh, oh, things are gonna change now for the better\nOh, oh, things are gonna change\n\n[Chorus]\nHands like secrets are the hardest things to keep from you\nLines and phrases like knives your words can cut me through\nDismantle me down, (Repair) you dismantle me, you dismantle me\nHands like secrets are the hardest things to keep from you\nLines and phrases like knives your words can cut me through\nDismantle me down, (Repair) you dismantle me, you dismantle me\nHands like secrets are the hardest things to keep from you\nLines and phrases like knives your words can cut me through\nDismantle me down, (Repair) you dismantle me, you dismantle me\nHands like secrets are the hardest things to keep from you\nLines and phrases like knives your words can cut me through\nDismantle me down, (Repair) you dismantle me, you dismantle me1Embed"
