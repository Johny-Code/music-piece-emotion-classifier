I don't know, try to make some real shit, you know\n\n[Verse 1]\nBye, you ain't never gonna see me again\nIf I can help it, little fellow take it easy\nFresh out of forced tears, kisses and hugs\nYou about to lose the company your misery loves\nAin't never did nothing but try to kill your disease\nAt least help the symptoms, instead you infected me\nI'm not the kind of man to draw a line in the sand\nIf you gotta draw at all then it's time for you to scram\nP.S., you can keep all this shit\nAnd hang around your broke friends and call yourself rich\nThe struggling I did with you was all for nothin'\nIt was never enough, your heart set on suffering\nI admit that I was weak in the beginnin'\nI wanted someone to need me instead of a friendship\nI didn't think I deserved a true partner\nSo I transferred the arrangement I had with my mama\n[Bridge]\nSince you never listen to a word I ever said\nMaybe seeing this door slam, will get it through your head\nI don't love you, I don't think I ever did\nAnd if you hadn't tried to kill me, I'd stayed for the kid\n\n[Hook] X 2\nThere's nothin'more for us to say\nGot my mind made up, I'm walking away\nSometimes we just outgrow the role that we play\nHope you find a happy ending to you story someday\n\n[Verse 2]\nRound and round and round we used to go\nI never fucked you right or made enough bread, I know\nIf I'm such a bastard, and mistreated you so\nThen how is it you're losing your mind to see me go?\nTruth be told, I held you together\nFor all them years, and I cheated on you never\nDefended your honor, took in your mama\nWhen she tried to rehab and had you back through the drama\nYou got a sick stone under your ribs\nWhere a heart is suppose to live\nSick, twisted and vindictive, with your windows dim\nBaby, you're not wicked hard bull fish, you must shiver\nHow you threaten to kill the most precious\nGift that you'll ever be blessed with?\nUnless you're twisted, demented and depressed and shit\nAnd alone cause you faithfully slayed your friendships\nYou might also like[Bridge]\n\n[Hook] X 2Embed"
