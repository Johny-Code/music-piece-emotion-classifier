Lee\n(It was never there on time)\nI'll go back to the Swanee\nWhere pellagra makes you scrawny\nAnd the Honeysuckle clutters up the vine\nI really am a-fixin'\nTo go home and start a-mixin'\nDown below that Mason-Dixon line\nOh, poll tax, how I love ya, how I love ya\nMy dear old poll tax\nWon'tcha come with me to Alabammy\nBack to the arms of my dear ol' Mammy\nHer cookin's lousy and her hands are clammy\nBut what the hell, it's home\nYes, for paradise the Southland is my nominee\nJes' give me a ham hock and a grit of hominy\n\nI wanna go back to Dixie\nI wanna be a dixie pixie\nAnd eat cornpone 'til it's comin' outta my ears\nI wanna talk with Southern gentlemen\nAnd put my white sheet on again\nI ain't seen one good lynchin' in years\nThe land of the boll weevil\nWhere the laws are medieval\nIs callin' me to come and nevermore roam\nI wanna go back to the Southland\nThat \"y'all\" and \"shet-ma-mouth\" land\nBe it ever so decadent\nThere's no place like homeYou might also like2Embed"
