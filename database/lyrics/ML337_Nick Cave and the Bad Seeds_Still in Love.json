        "lyrics": "Still In Love Lyrics[Verse 1]\nThe cops are hanging around the house\nThe cars outside look like they've got the blues\nThe moon don't know if it's day or night\nEverybody's creeping around with plastic covers on their shoes\nYou're making coffee for everyone concerned\nSomeone points to this and someone points to that\nEveryone is saying that you should lie down\nBut you ain't having none of that\nAnd I say to the sleepy summer rain\nWith a complete absence of pain\nYou might think I'm crazy\nBut I'm still in love with you\n[Verse 2]\nHide your eyes, hide your tears\nHide your face, my love\nHide your ribbons, hide your bows\nHide your coloured cotton gloves\nHide your trinkets, hide your treasures\nHide your neatly scissored locks\nHide your memories, hide them all\nStuff them in a cardboard box\nOr throw them into the street below\nLeave them to the wind and the rain and the snow\nFor you might think I'm crazy\nBut I'm still in love with you\nCall me up, baby, and I will answer your call\nCall me up but remember I am no use to you at all\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow, you're standing at the top of the stairs\nOne hand on the banister, a flower in your hair\nThe other one resting on your hip\nWithout a solitary care\nI fall to sleep in the summer rain\nWith no single memory of pain\nAnd you might think I'm crazy\nBut I'm still in love with youYou might also likeEmbed"
