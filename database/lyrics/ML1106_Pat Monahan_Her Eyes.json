        "lyrics": "Her Eyes LyricsShe's not afraid; she just likes to use her night light\nWhen she gets paid, true religion gets it all\nIf they fit right\n\nShe's a little bit manic, completely organic\nDoesn't panic for the most part\n\nShe's old enough to know, and young enough not to say no\nTo any chance that she gets for home plate tickets to see the Mets\nLike everybody, she's in over her head\nDreads Feds, Grateful Dead, and doesn't take meds\nShe's a Gemini Capricorn\nThinks all men are addicted to porn\nI don't agree with her half the time\nBut, damn I'm glad she's mine\n\nHer eyes, that's where hope lies\nThat's where blue skies\nMeet the sunrise\nHer eyes, that's where I go\nWhen I go home\n\nShe got the kinda strength that every man wishes he had\nShe loved Michael Jackson up until he made Bad\n\nTells me that she lives about a hundred lives\nScares me to death when she thinks and drives\nSays cowboy hats make her look fat\nAnd I'm so glad she's mine\n\nHer eyes, that's where hope lies\nThat's where blue skies\nMeet the sunrise\nHer eyes, that's where I go\nWhen I go home\n\nShe doesn't know the word 'impossible'\nDon't care where I've been and doesn't care where we're goin' to\nShe takes me as I am, and that ain't easy\nShe's beautiful. So beautiful\nYou might also likeAnd sometimes I think she's truly crazy\nAnd I love it\n\nHer eyes, that's where hope lies\nThat's where blue skies\nAlways meet the sunrise\nHer eyes, that's where I go\nWhen I go home\n\nHer eyes, that's where hope lies\nThat's where blue skies\nAlways meet the sunrise\nHer eyes, that's where I go\nWhen I go home\n\nShe's not afraid\nShe just likes to use her night lightEmbed"
