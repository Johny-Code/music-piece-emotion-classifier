We've had our fun\nSoho! So you, not me my love\nSoho, so there\nSo now we're done\nYou remember when we would play\nLife with you was a beautiful game\nSoho! So long!\nYou remember when we would play\nLife with you was a beautiful game\nSoho! So long!\n\nSoho nights were the times we\nReveled in each other's company\nWe danced like fools and acted like queens\nAmong the type with some red jeans\n\nSoho nights were thrilling rides\nThe more fun we had, the more makeup would slide\nThe more the makeup would slide I'd see\nSoho really wasn't for me\n\nSoho, so long! We've had our fun\nSoho! So you, not me my love\nSoho, so there\nSo now we're done\n\nYou remember when we would play\nLife with you was a beautiful game\nSoho! So long!\nYou remember when we would play\nLife with you was a beautiful game\nSoho! So long!\nYou might also likeYou remember when we would play\nLife with you was a beautiful game\nSoho! So long\n\nSoho nights were so black and white\nThe color came throughout the night\nThe more we took, like everyone else\nThe more alive the both of us felt\n\nSoho nights opened my eyes\nI've become a hag by your side\nI thought we'd last, but I was wrong\nSoho boys don't keep ties for long\n\nSoho, so long! We've had our fun\nSoho! So you, not me my love\nSoho, so there\nSo now we're--\n\nYou remember when we would play\nLife with you was a beautiful game\nSoho! So long!\nYou remember when we would play\nLife with you was a beautiful game\nSoho! So long!Embed"
