Punk\n\n[Verse 2]\nI didn't stand a chance\nI couldn't stand at all\nYou looked OK with the others\nYou looked great on your own\nIt was 2002 and you couldn't be bothered\nTo say hello or goodbye\nOr stand the test of time\nYou did, I just tried to\nSeparate an ocean from these tears we cried\n(Whoooo)\n\n[Chorus]\nWhere did you get that line?\nWhere did you get that look?\nWhere did you get that penchant for destruction in the way you talk?\nWhere did you get that ride?\nWhere did you get that rocket?\nWhere did you get that painter in your pocket?\n\n[Verse 3]\nHey, there's Christine\nAnd there's where she could've been\nThe summer season was cheap\nBirds of prey stick together\nAnd hey so do we\n\n(Go)\n\n[Verse 4]\nI didn't stand a chance\nI couldn't stand at all\nYou looked OK with the others\nYou looked great by yourself\nIt was 2002 and you needed reminding to stay alive\nAnd so did I, but at least I tried to\nFall upon that sword and never look back\nYou might also like(Ahh)\n\n[Chorus]\nWhere did you get that line?\nWhere did you get that look?\nWhere did you get that penchant for destruction in the way you talk?\nWhere did you get that ride?\nWhere did you get that rocket?\nWhere did you get that painter in your pocket?\nWhere did you get that line?\nWhere did you get that look?\nWhere did you get that penchant for destruction in the way you talk?\nWhere did you get that ride?\nWhere did you get that rocket?\nWhere did you get that painter in your pocket?\n\n[Outro]\nI didn't stand a chance\nI didn't stand at all\nYou looked OK with the others1Embed"
