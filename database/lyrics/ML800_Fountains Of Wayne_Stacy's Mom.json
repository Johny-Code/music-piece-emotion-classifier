You're just not the girl for me\nI know it might be wrong, but I'm in love with Stacy's mom\nStacy's mom has got it goin' on\nStacy's mom has got it goin' on\n\n[Verse 2]\nStacy, do you remember when I mowed your lawn? (Mowed your lawn)\nYour mom came out with just a towel on (Towel on)\nI could tell she liked me from the way she stared (Way she stared)\nAnd the way she said, \"You missed a spot over there\" (Spot over there)\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nAnd I know that you think it's just a fantasy\nBut since your dad walked out, your mom could use a guy like me\n\n[Chorus]\nStacy's mom has got it going on\nShe's all I want and I've waited for so long\nStacy, can't you see? You're just not the girl for me\nI know it might be wrong, but I'm in love with Stacy's mom\nYou might also like[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Chorus]\nStacy's mom has got it goin' on (She's got it goin' on)\nShe's all I want and I've waited for so long (Waited and waited)\nStacy, can't you see?
