I don't know about malevolent\nSure as hell decadent, I want somebody to step up, step off\nWalls, let me fall, fuck you all\nGet a grip, don't let me slip till I drop the ball\n[Chorus]\nFuck this shit, I'm sick of it, you're going down, this is a war\nFuck it!\n\n[Verse 2]\nWho the fuck am I to criticize your twisted state of mind?\nYou're leaving me suspect, I'm leaving you grotesque\nFeels like a burn from which you never learn\nCause and effect you jealous ass, press your face against the glass, suffer\n\n[Chorus]\nFuck this shit, I'm sick of it, you're going down, this is a war\nGo\n\n[Bridge]\nI've just begun, it's about that time, gotta get mine\nI've just begun, it's about that time, gotta get mine\nI've just begun, it's about that time, gotta get mine\nI've just begun, it's about that time, gotta get mine\nYou can't kill me 'cause I'm already inside you\nYou can't kill me 'cause I'm already inside you\nYou can't kill me 'cause I'm already inside you\nYou can't kill me 'cause I'm already inside you\n\n[Outro]\nSick, sick, sick, sick\nYeahYou might also like28Embed"
