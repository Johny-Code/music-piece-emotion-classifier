Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]\nAh!\n\n[Verse 1]\nMy mother was a witch, she was burned alive\nThankless little bitch for the tears I cried\nTake her down now, don't want to see her face\nBlistered and burned, can't hide my disgrace\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nTwenty-seven, everyone was nice\nGot to see them, make them pay the price\nSee their bodies out on the ice\nTake my time\n[Chorus]\nAm I evil? Yes I am\nAm I evil? I am man, yes I am\n\n[Verse 2]\nAs I watched my mother die, I lost my head\nRevenge now I sought to break with my bread\nTaking no chances, you come with me\nI'll split you to the bone, help set you free\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nTwenty-seven, everyone was nice\nGot to see them, make them pay the price\nSee their bodies out on the ice\nTake my time\n\n[Chorus]\nAm I evil? Yes I am\nAm I evil? I am man, yes I am\n\nOhoh!\n\n[Verse 3]\nOn with the action now, I'll strip your pride\nI'll spread your blood around, I'll see you ride\nYour face is scarred with steel, wounds deep and neat\nLike a double dozen before you, smells so sweet\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nAm I evil? Yes I am\nAm I evil? I am man\n\n[Verse 4]\nMy soul is longing before, await my hell\nSent to avenge my mother, sleep myself\nMy face is long forgotten, my face not my own\nSweet and timely whore, take me home\n\n[Chorus]\nAm I evil? Yes I am\nAm I evil? I am man, yes I am\n\nOhh..\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Verse 5]\nOn with the action now, I'll strip your pride\nI'll spread your blood around, I'll see you ride\nYour face is scarred with steel, your spirits dance\nLike a double dozen before you, no romance\n\n[Chorus]\nAm I evil? Yes I am\nAm I evil? I am man\nAm I evil? Yes I am\nAm I evil? I am man, yes I am5Embed"
