As Christians we gotta take on the armor of Christ and go to battle against Satan\n\n[Verse 1]\nMan in the front got a sinister grin\nCareen down highway 666\nWe wanna go, crush the slow\nAs the pitchfork bends the needles grow\n\n[Chorus]\nMy arms are wheels, my legs are wheels\nMy blood is pavement\nWe're gonna ride to the abbey of Thelema, to the abbey of Thelema\nBlood is pavement\nYeah\n[Verse 2]\nGrill in the front is my sinister grin\nBugs in my teeth make me sick, sick, sick\nThe objects may be larger than\nThey appear in the mirror\n\n[Chorus]\nMy arms are wheels, my legs are wheels\nBlood is pavement\nWe're gonna ride to the abbey of Thelema, to the abbey of Thelema\nBlood is pavement!\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nWhen you ride, you're ridden\nWhen you ride, you're ridden\n\n[Interlude]\nBeep beep, beep beep\nHis horn went beep beep beep\n\n[Bridge]\nI am fueled by filth and fury\nDo what I will, I will hurry there, there\n\n[Chorus]\nYeah!\nMy arms are wheels, my legs are wheels\nMy blood is pavement\nMy arms are wheels, my legs are wheels\nMy blood is pavement, yeah\nFuck it\nMy arms are wheels, my legs are wheels\nMy blood is pavement\nMy arms are wheels, my legs are wheels\nMy blood is pavement, pavement, pavement!\nYeah, yeah, yeah!\nYeah, yeah, yeah!\nYou might also like[Outro]\nGo home to your mother! Doesn't she ever watch you!? Tell her this isn't some Communist day-care center! Tell your mother I hate her! Tell your mother I hate you!\n[Phone Ringing]\nI want my son off of your mailing list, I have already contacted the post office about your pornographic material that is being received in the mail, my next stop is my attorney. I do not want this number called anymore, and I do not want anything delivered to my address. If I receive anything else from this band, or this group, my next phone call will be my attorney, and you will be contacted. Thank you and good-bye!1Embed"
