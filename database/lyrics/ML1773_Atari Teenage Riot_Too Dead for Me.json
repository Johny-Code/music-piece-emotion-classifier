I don't wanna listen...\nIt would destroy the last dreams I've left for you...\nToo dead for - too dead for - (x8)\nToo dead for me! (x5)\nI run around to see my soul smashed into pieces\nLike a hole in my chest and it burns and it burns\nIt never stops!\nThey can't wait to waste my youth\nConsumed like a corporation's entity\nAnd then it stops! it just stops!\n\nCome on!\nWatch out! watch out!\nFools around me through the back door\nBackbite! and we define what's hardcore!\nAnd that's what I am! that's where I go!\nI never understood what you sold your soul for...\nToo dead for - too dead for - (x10)\nToo dead for me! (x7)\nWhat do you say?\n\nToo dead for - too dead for - (x3)\nWhat do you say?\nToo dead for me...\nWhat do you say?You might also likeEmbed"
