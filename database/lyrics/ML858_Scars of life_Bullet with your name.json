It's wrong, can't you see?\nYou wanna leave me here, and forget about me\n\nYou look me, in my face\nTell me I'm, a disgrace\n\nYou say that you're the victim\nI say you're full of shit\nAll the times you stuck me here\nAnd put me on my own\nI feel the same, that's why\nI've got a bullet with your name\n\nAs we're sitting here, staring each other down\nI remember how you used to kick me around\nLook deep in my eyes, come take all my pain\nI only have just one bullet with your name\n\nYou look me, in my face\nTell me I'm, a disgrace\n\nYou say that you're the victim\nI say you're full of shit\n\nAll the times you stuck me here\nAnd put me on my own\nI feel the same, that's why\nI've got a bullet with your name\n\nThat's why\nGET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME!\n\nLook deep in my eyes\nCome take the pain from me\nAll I ask of you\nIs to get away from me\nYou might also likeYou look me, in my face\nTell me I'm, a disgrace\n\nYou say that you're the victim\nI say you're full of shit\n\nAll the times you stuck me here\nAnd put me on my own\nI feel the same, that's why\nI've got a bullet with your name\n\nAll the times you stuck me here\nAnd put me on my own\nI feel the same, that's why\nI've got a bullet with your nameEmbed"
