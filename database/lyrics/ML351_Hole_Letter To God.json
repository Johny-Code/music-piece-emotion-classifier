Are You proud?\nHaven't I done everything? Everything?\nI'm so sorry I'm so weak\nAnd I've turned into a freak\nBut I don't know anything, anything\nI've lost all self-esteem\nBy burying everything\nAnd I feel nothing, nothing\nOh, God, please tell me now\nOh, God, please tell me now\n'Cause I feel nothing\nAnd dear God\nI'm writing this letter to You\nI am coming unglued\nPlease help me1Embed"
