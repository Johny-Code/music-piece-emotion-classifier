Make me forget, you promised me\nTime will heal, make me forget, you promised me\nLove will save us all, and time will heal, you promised me\nYou promised me, you promised me\nHow love will save? Make me forget, you promised me\nLove will save, make me forget, you promised me\nTime will heal us all, and love will save, you promised me\nI trusted you, I wanted your words\nBelieved in you, I needed your words\nTime will heal, make me forget\nAnd love, love will save us all\n[Chorus]\nYou promised me another wish, another way\nYou promised me another dream, another day\nYou promised me another time, you promised me another life\nYou promised me\nYou promised me\nYou promised me\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo I swallowed the shame and I waited, buried the blame and I waited\nChoked back years of memories, I pushed down the pain, I waited\nTrying to forget\nTrying to forget\nTrying to forget\nTrying to forget\nTrying to forget\n\n[Chorus]\nYou promised me another wish, another way\nYou promised me another dream, another day\nYou promised me another time, you promised me another lie\nYou promised me\nYou promised me\nYou promised me\nYou promised me\nYou might also like[Outro]\nHere I waited, and I waited, and I waited\nAnd I waited, and I waited, and I waited\nAnd I'm still waiting3Embed"
