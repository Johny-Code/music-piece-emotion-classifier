Did you hide?\nWhy'd you leave, no goodbye?\nWhen the clouds take the sky\nDoes a storm give you life?\n\nAnd every time it rains\nI feel her holding me\nAnd every time it rains\nAre the angels crying?\n\nAnd every time it rains\nI feel her holding me\nAnd every time it rains\nAll the angels cry for me\n\nI'll never be the same\nI'll never be the same\nBe the same\nBe the same\n\nAnd every time it rains\nI feel her holding me\nAnd every time it rains\nAre the angels crying?\n\nAnd every time it rains\nI feel her holding me\nAnd every time it rains\nAre the angels crying?You might also likeEmbed"
