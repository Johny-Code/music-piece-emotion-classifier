Yo, what's goin' on?\nNo one really knows what I'm talkin' about\nAnd yeah, that's right, my name's Yauch...\n[DJ scratching]\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nPonce De Leon, constantly on\nThe fountain of youth, not Robotron\nPeace is a word I've heard before\nSo move and move and move up on the dance floor\nCuz I'm gonna die, gonna die one day\nCuz I'm goin' and goin' and goin' this way\nNot like a roach or a piece of toast\nI'm goin' out first class, ain't goin' out coach\nRock my Adidas, never rock Filas\nI do not sniff the coke, I only smoke the sinsemilla\nWell, with my nose I knows, and with my scope I scopes\nWhat I live I write, and that's strictly rope\nI got science for any occasion\nPostulating theorems, formulating equations\nWell, Cheech Wizard in a snow blizzard\nEat a chicken gizzard with a girl named Lizzy\n\n[Outro]\nDropping science like Galileo dropped the orange3Embed"
