Didn't you?\nThe ruiner's got a lot to prove\nHe's got nothing to lose and now he made you believe\nThe ruiner's your only friend\nWell he's the living end to the cattle he deceives\nThe raping of the innocent\nYou know the ruiner ruins everything he sees\nNow the only pure thing left\nIn my fucking world is wearing your disease\n[Chorus]\nHow'd you get so big?\nHow'd you get so strong?\nHow'd it get so hard?\nHow'd it get so long?\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou had to give them all a sign\nDidn't you? Didn't you?\nYou had to covet what was mine\nDidn't you?  Didn't you?\nThe ruiner's a collector\nHe's an infector serving his shit to his flies\nMaybe there will come a day\nWhen those that you keep blind will suddenly realize\nMaybe it's a part of me you took\nTo a place I hoped it would never go\nAnd maybe that fucked me up\nMuch more than you'll ever know\n\n[Chorus]\nHow'd you get so big?\nHow'd you get so strong?\nHow'd you get so hard?\nHow'd it get so long?\nAnd what you gave to me\nMy perfect ring of scars\nYou know I can see\nWhat you really are\nYou might also like[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Outro]\nYou didn't hurt me\nNothing can hurt me\nYou didn't hurt me\nNothing can stop me now\nYou didn't hurt me\nNothing can hurt me\nYou didn't hurt me\nNothing can stop me now\nYou didn't hurt me\nNothing can hurt me\nYou didn't hurt me\nNothing can stop me now\nYou didn't hurt me\nNothing can hurt me\nYou didn't hurt me\nNothing can stop me now\nYou didn't hurt me\nNothing can hurt me\nYou didn't hurt me\nNothing can stop me now\nYou didn't hurt me\nNothing can hurt me\nYou didn't hurt me\nNothing can stop-15Embed"
