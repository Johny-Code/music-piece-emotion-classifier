Thistles and thorns\nAmong the sand\nI can't believe that it's so cold\nAnd there ain't been no snow\nThe sound of music it comes to me\nFrom every place I go\nSunday morning, there's no one in church\nBut the clergy's chosen man\nBushes and briars, thistles and thorns\nUpon the landYou might also likeEmbed"
