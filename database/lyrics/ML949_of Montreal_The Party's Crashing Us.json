Jump, jump!\n\nOoh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh-oh\n\n[Chorus 2]\nI only feel all right when the VU is flashing\nAlarms going off in my head\nI want to grab you, want to scream at you, no icing me\nDown\nThe party's crashing us now\nI only feel all right when the VU is flashing\nAnd bombs going off in my head\nI want to grab you and just kiss you\nMaybe I should come down\nNo sense in cashing us now\n\nParty's crashing us now2Embed"
