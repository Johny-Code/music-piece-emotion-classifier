Nobody but me\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I don't wanna be an old man anymore\nIt's been a year or two since I was out on the floor\nShakin' booty, makin' sweet love all the night\nIt's time I got back to the good life\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nIt's time I got back, it's time I got back\nAnd I don't even know how I got off the track\nI wanna go back, yeah\n\n[Verse 3]\nScrew this crap, I've had it (I've had it)\nI ain't no Mr. Cool\nI'm a pig, I'm a dog\nSo 'scuse me if I drool\nI ain't gonna hurt nobody, ain't gonna cause a scene\nJust need to admit that I want sugar in my tea\n(Hear me?) Hear me? I want sugar in my tea\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nAnd I don't wanna be an old man anymore\nIt's been a year or two since I was out on the floor\nShakin' booty, makin' sweet love all the night\nIt's time I got back to the good life\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nIt's time I got back, it's time I got back\nAnd I don't even know how I got off the track\nI wanna go back, yeah\n\n[Bridge]\nI wanna go back, I wanna go back\nAnd I don't even know how I got off the track\nIt's time I got back, it's time I got back\nAnd I don't even know how I got off the track\nI wanna go back, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I don't wanna be an old man anymore\nIt's been a year or two since I was out on the floor\nShakin' booty, makin' sweet love all the night\nIt's time I got back to the good life\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nIt's time I got back, it's time I got back\nAnd I don't even know how I got off the track\nIt's time I got back, it's time I got back\nAnd I don't even know how I got off the track\nI wanna go back\nI wanna go back11Embed"
