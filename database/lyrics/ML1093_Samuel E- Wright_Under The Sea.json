A lot of sand\nWe got a hot, crustacean band\nEach little clam here, know how to jam here\nUnder the sea\nEach little slug here, cuttin' a rug here\nUnder the sea\n[Post-Chorus: Sebastian]\nEach little snail here\nKnow how to wail here\nThat's why it's hotter\nUnder the water\nYa we in luck here\nDown in the muck here\nUnder the sea4Embed"
