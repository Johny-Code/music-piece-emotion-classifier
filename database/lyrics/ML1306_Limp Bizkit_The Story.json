True Hollywood Story\nTake a man down with his own glory? Now guess who's next\n\n[Verse 2]\nAt some point, we come down from the highs\nAnd so be it, we move on with our lives\nSome of us let the laughs cover cries\nDo the math, you can laugh when I die\nIf life is just a fantasy, then could you\nLive this fantasy life? If so, then would you?\nJust remember that the doors are not closeable\nAnd your motherfucking heroes are disposable\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's an E! True Hollywood Story\nTake a man down with his own glory? Now guess who's next\nIt's an E! True Hollywood Story\nTake a man down with his own glory? Now guess who's next\n\n[Refrain]\nJust live and let die, just live and let\nJust live and let, just live and let die\nJust live and let die, just live and let\nJust live and let\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nSo what about the hardcore that ain't hard anymore?\nOr the shit talkers who ain't shit anymore\nOr the old fighters who can't fight anymore?\nOr the white kids who ain't white anymore?\nOr the actors that don't act anymore?\nOr the rappers that don't rap anymore?\nOr the hipsters that don't hip anymore?\nOr the limpsters that don't limp anymore? Come on\n\n[Refrain]\nJust live and let die, just live and let\nJust live and let, just live and let die\nJust live and let die, just live and let\nJust live and let, just live and let die\n\n[Bridge]\nBut no, it's impossible\nJust to live your, live your life and let us die\nOh, motherfuck that!\nYou wanna talk about some shit?! Let's talk about the\n\n[Verse 3]\nHardcore that ain't hard anymore\nOr the shit talkers who ain't shit anymore\nOr the old fighters who can't fight anymore\nOr the white kids who ain't white anymore\nOr the actors that can't act anymore\nOr the rappers that can't anymore\nOr the hipsters that can't hip anymore\nOr the limpsters that can't limp anymore, come on!\n[Chorus]\nIt's an E! True Hollywood Story\nTake a man down with his own glory? Now guess who's next\nIt's an E! True Hollywood Story!\nTake a man down with his own glory? Now guess who's next!1Embed"
