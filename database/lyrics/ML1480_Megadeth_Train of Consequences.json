My name is Trouble.\"\nI'm coming in for the kill\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIn for the kill\nOoh, and you know I will\n[Chorus]\nSet the ball a-rolling\nI'll be clicking off the miles\nOn the train of consequences\nMy boxcar life of style\nMy thinking is derailed\nI'm tied up to the tracks\nThe train of consequences\nThere ain't no turning back, oh\n\n[Verse 2]\nNo horse ever ran as fast\nAs the money that you bet\nI'm blowing on my cards\nAnd I play them to my chest\nLife's fabric is corrupt\nShot through with corroded thread\nAs for me, I hocked my brains\nPacked my bags and headed west, ah\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI hocked my brains\nHeaded west\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, set the ball a-rolling\nI'll be clicking off the miles\nOn the train of consequences\nMy boxcar life of style\nMy thinking is derailed\nI'm tied up to the tracks\nThe train of consequences\nThere ain't no turning back\nYou might also like[Instrumental Break]\n[Guitar Solo: Marty Friedman]\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, set the ball a-rolling\nI'll be clicking off the miles\nOn the train of consequences\nMy boxcar life of style\nMy thinking is derailed\nI'm tied up to the tracks\nThe train of consequences\nThere ain't no turning back\nSet the ball a-rolling\nI'll be clicking off the miles\nOn the train of consequences\nMy boxcar life of style\nMy thinking is derailed\nI'm tied up to the tracks\nThe train of consequences\nThere ain't no turning back\n\n[Guitar Solo: Dave Mustaine]\n(Hahahahahaha)2Embed"
