        "lyrics": "IKEA Lyrics[Verse 1]\nLong ago in days of yore\nIt all began with a god named Thor\nThere were Vikings and boats\nAnd some plans for a furniture store\nIt's not a bodega, it's not a mall\nAnd they sell things for apartments smaller than mine\nAs if there were apartments smaller than mine\n\n[Chorus]\nIkea: Just some oak and some pine and a handful of Norsemen\nIkea: Selling furniture for college kids and divorced men\nEveryone has a home\nBut if you don't have a home you can buy one there\n[Verse 2]\nSo rent a car or take the bus\nLay your cash down and put your trust\nIn the land where the furniture folds to a much smaller size\nBilly the bookcase says hello\nAnd so does a table whose name is Ingo\nAnd the chair is a ladder-back birch but his friends call him Karl\n\n[Chorus]\nIkea: Just some oak and some pine and a handful of Norsemen\nIkea: Selling furniture for college kids and divorced men\nEveryone has a home\nBut if you don't have a home you can buy one there\n\n[Bridge]\nIkea: Plywood, brushed steel\nIkea: Meatballs, tasty\nIkea: Allen wrenches\nAll of them for free\nAll of them for me\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm sorry I said Ikea sucks\nI just bought a table for 60 bucks\nAnd a chair and a lamp\nAnd a shelf and some candles for you\nI was a doubter just like you\nTill I saw the American dream come true\nIn New Jersey, they got a goddamned Swedish parade\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nIkea: Just some oak and some pine and a handful of Norsemen\nIkea: Selling furniture for college kids and divorced men\nEveryone has a home\nBut if you don't have a home you can buy one there1Embed"
