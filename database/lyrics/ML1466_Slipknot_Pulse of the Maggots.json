Yes\n(Do you understand?) Yes\n(Do you understand?) Yes\n(Do you understand?) Yes\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Bridge]\nSay it again, say it again\n(We won't die)\nSay it again, say it again\n(We won't die)\nSay it again, say it again\n(We won't die)\nSay it again, say it again\n(We won't die)\nSay it again, say it again\n(We won't die)\nSay it again, say it again\n(We won't die)\nSay it again, say it again\n(We won't die)\nSay it again, say it again\n(We won't die)\n[Verse 3]\nWe fight 'til no one can fight us\nWe live and no one can stop us\nWe pull when we're pushed too far\nAnd the advantage is, the bottom line is\nWe never had to fight in the first place\nWe only had to spit back at their face\nWe won't walk alone any longer\nWhat doesn't kill us only makes us stronger\n\n[Chorus]\n(We) we are the new diabolic\n(We) we are the bitter bucolic\nIf I have to give my life, you can have it\n(We) we are the pulse of the maggots\n\n[Post-Chorus]\n(Do you understand?) Yes\n(Do you understand?) Yes\n(Do you understand?) Yes\n(Do you understand?) Yes\n\n[Outro]\nSay it again, say it again\n(We won't die)\nSay it again, say it again\n(We won't die)\nSay it again, say it again\n(We won't die)\nSay it again, say it again\n(We won't die)19Embed"
