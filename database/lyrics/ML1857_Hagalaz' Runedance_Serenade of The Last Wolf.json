        "lyrics": "Serenade Of The Last Wolf LyricsHe runs into the night\nFinding a place to hide;\nWhy do they hunt him again?\n\nHis heart, it beats so fast;\nNo sound, they moved on at last\nTimidly he wanders his way\n\nThe outcast, he enters their town\nSenseless hate haunts him now;\nThe outcast with more feeling then they'll ever know\nHe only came for some food\nMaybe even company;\nSometimes he feels so alone\n\nHe is the last one of his kind\nAll his companions have died;\nMan signed their fatal destiny\n\nHis dreams tell him of ancient times\nOf wolves and men running side by side;\nHow delightful freedom must have been\n\nWild woman's mate and totem-beast\nIdolized he was, but suddenly all changed;\nWhen the men with false dogmas came\n\nYou call him the evil beast?\nBut you are the real evil beast!\nYou, who damned nature's dearest child\n\nHe cries his sorrow to the moon\nA tear shines through the misty gloom\nCan't you hear the last wolf's serenade?\n\nThey came wild and free\nLife in it's livery\nStealing life from the land's living\nYou might also likeAlone he sits by the lake\nHis image in the lake his only friend\nCan't you hear the last wolf's serenade?\n\nCan't you hear the last wolf's serenade?Embed"
