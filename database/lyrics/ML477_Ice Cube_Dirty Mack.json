Mothafuck Roger Rabbit\n'Cause I couldn't have and got stabbed in the back\nBy a black ass dirty mack...\n[Hook]\nAnd if you didn't know it's like that\nI got a big fat gat for the dirty mack\nYeah nigga you didn't you know it was like that\nI got a big fat gat for the dirty mack...\n\n[Verse 2]\nThere goes the Billboard, pull it\nAnd see if I'm still #1 with a bullet\nWhat the fuck do I see?\nIt looks like the Predator\nIs gettin' dissed by the editor\nLook, the vanilla wafer caper\nIs to lynch a nigga on paper\nBut I'm much too black for the god damn cracker\nHuh! Dirty Macker\nEven the Guardian Angels got mental\nBut never seen their ass walking through South Central\nLittle superhero don't let me catch ya\nI fuck around and wetcha\nTry to dirty mack me out\nTry to take food out my kid's mouth\nYou're lucky that my people are stronger than your evil\nOr your ass woulda got the heave, hoe\nOut the do, the 187 tag's still on your toe\nSo act like you know\nThat nigga that's known to jack\nDevils in little red hats\nMotherfuckin dirty macks\nYou might also like[Hook]\nAnd if you didn't know it's like that\nI got a big fat gat for the dirty mack\nYeah nigga you didn't you know it was like that\nI got a big fat gat for the dirty mack...\n\n[Verse 3]\nDon't come the O.G. way with that 'he say she say'\nBitch, hit the freeway, dirty macks get tossed\n'Cause I'll fuck around, and jump your ass like Kris Kross\nJust might blast, snake in the grass\nGet a shank up the ass\nFound in a trunk of funk\nPale and stiff as a philly blunt\nWhat more do you want you done fucked up the plot\nAnd deserve just what you got\n'Cause I'm hotter than Tobasco\nYou little ass hoe\nNow I gotta do you like Glass Joe\nTKO now you see they fall on canvas\n'Cause you scandalous\nDon't know who the man is\nIce Cube-a jack\nThe wack ass Dirt Mack\n\n[Outro]\nAnd if you didn't know it's like that\nI got a big fat gat for the dirty mack\nYo Savage didn't you know it was like that\nI got a big fat gat for the dirty mack\nI suppose you don't know it's like that\nI got a big fat gat for the dirty mack...3Embed"
