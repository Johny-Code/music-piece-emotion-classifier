Lee\nNow I don't mind chopping wood\nAnd I don't care if the money's no good\nJust take what you need and leave the rest\nBut they should never have taken the very best\n\n[Chorus]\nThe night they drove old Dixie down\nAnd all the bells were ringin'\nThe night they drove old Dixie down\nAnd all the people were singin'\nThey went:\nLa, la, la, la, la, la, la\nLa, la, la, la, la, la\nLa, la, la\n\n[Verse 3]\nLike my father before me, I'm a working man\nAnd like my brother before me, I took a rebel stand\nOh, he was just eighteen, proud and brave\nBut a yankee laid him in his grave\nI swear by the blood below my feet\nYou can't raise a Caine back up when he's in defeat\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nThe night they drove old Dixie down\nAnd all the bells were ringin'\nThe night they drove old Dixie down\nAnd all the people were singin'\nThey went:\nLa, la, la, la, la, la, la\nLa, la, la, la, la, la\nLa, la, la2Embed"
