I didn't feel myself\nEvaporating...\n\nMy body has gone\nBut my eyes remain\nHovering. Witnessing\nCold as a ghost ... watching the streets\nSheltering in doorways of\nVenice, Vienna\nBudapest, Krakow, and Amsterdam\nI have become the invisible man\n\nThe invisible heart beating against you\nThe invisible pulse silently thumping\n\nI shout my name in the public places\nNo one seems to notice\nNo one understands\nI stand perfectly still\nIn the middle of the road\nI hold my nerve\nI hold my nerve\nHold my nerve\nBut the cars don't swerve\n\nI will hear your prayers\nAs you whisper alone\nI am the one you felt was close\nClose behind you in St. Stephen\nYou lit a candle\nBlessings in the cold night air\n\nI'll feel your breath as you turn to go\nI'll watch you leave\nFrom somewhere up high\nAs you cross the park\nIn the Autumn light\nIn the Autumn light\nIn the Autumn light\nYou might also likeIf I close my eyes\nI can see where you live\nClimb the winding stairs\nUp to your apartment\nThe scent of you preparing\nHis evening meal\nI must watch in dread\nWhen he's cruel to you\nIn horrified silence\nAs you make love\nI cannot lift a hand\nLift a hand to stop him\nI don't exist What can I do?\nWhat can I do?\n\nI will scream in your ear\nAs you're passing by\nI will wrap my arms around you\nYou won't hear, you won't feel me\nI will walk stride for stride with you\nI will try to help\nWhen you stumble\nYou will stumble through me\n\nI have become the invisible man\nIt's all I am\nInvisible\nI have read all your letters\nI know what you contain\nI have dreamt your dreams\nMy head..\nMy head is haunted\nI will scream again\n\"I am perfectly sane\"\n\"I am perfectly sane\"\nBut I am\nThe invisible man\nI am\nThe invisible man\n\nTalk to me\nAcknowledge me\nConfide in me\nConfess to me ... or\nLeave me be\nLeave me beEmbed"
