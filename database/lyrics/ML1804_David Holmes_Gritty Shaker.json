        "lyrics": "Gritty Shaker LyricsI'm sittin' at a coffee table, unable to see straight\nWatchin' parallel lines unwind and undulate\nBehind the rain-streaked windowpane, the scene's bleak\nAnother train leavin' home\nConceding defeat with a low moan\n\nHangin' in a sky, made of stone\nEverybody's leavin' home, I called my man Jerome\nTo come meet me in the twilight zone\nLeave your mobile phone at home and come alone\nI bought him coffee and a snack\nSettled back, started speakin'\nHe was tweakin' with the peak of his cap\nWhile I'm seekin' to discover what it takes to stay sober\nNot cover my mistakes\nTry to maybe make sense of the evidence\nIt's over, she's gone for good\nWhy should I lie, singin' a killer's lullaby\nIdentified by the dying ring of her goodbye\nThe last thing you hear before your life disappear\n\nNow it just gets worse, like my stomach will burst\nFeel like I've been cursed\nWith seven centuries of bitter memories\nAnd inadequacies, previous he's and she's\nI'm movin' round this old house for the last time\nScene of my past crimes, been here for lifetimes\nHearin' the chimes of the old clock that used to mock\n\nYou got eternity for takin' stock\nThis place is like a padlock\nYou look shocked\nTrust me, nothing ever moves but the dust\nThere's just us and I'm here to torment and tease\nAnd that's how it was for centuries\nMe and my memories, till you brought the keys\nYou might also likeTook the couple of Saturdays\nI moved in runnin' from tragedies and boozing\nSeven hundred years since I came here\nYou appear, same hair, same quizzical stare\nI couldn't get near\nAnd the sheer frustration was more than I could bear\nI was really cursed, thought I'd been through the worst part\n\nThat was just the first part, just the start\nEvery night I'd be sitting with dread, breaking my heart\nIn case the man she'd been chasin' gets to first base\nAnd I just can't escape, I'm in bad shape\nYou making love to someone else is more than I can take\nAnd so I make all the movement I can to no avail\nScream and yell, sinkin' deeper into my personal Hell\n\nI'm getting heated, I'm sorry, have another coffee\nI needed to release my sparrow chest\nFrom just a piece of this pressure\nUnless an escape route is found\nI'm going down underground\nInto lifetimes of pain, it's absurd\nThe heaviest chain is contained is the sound of one word\nSo I'm referred back to Hell, huh\nJust as well, I hate needles an' get twinges\nAt the thought of syringes\nJ, I'm going insane with shame\nI dream and watch her makin' love over and over again\nWith what I call a farmer's swain\nUnintelligent, pea-brained retard who's dick is always hard\nOh God, of course I'm jealous, fellows\nOversexed flexing his pec's\nJesus, what's he going make her do next?\nI'm mad vex, the way she gently scratches his chest\n\nYou used to do that to me back in 1253\nPity me, while you lie with your lover\nI stare and suffer in despair while you ruffle his hair\nUnaware of who else is there\nI move quick, I want to try my trick one last time\nYou know it's possible to vaguely define my outline\nWhen dust move in the sunshine\nSo I'm tryin' to change, vibrate myself to near human pitch\n\nWhich reminds me how I used to come unstitched\nAnd switch 'round the house in a blind rage\nIt took years and an ocean of tears\nTo find the key to this cage\nAnd write another stage into a new age\nIt's difficult to gauge\nBut I know that I'll see you again, on that you may depend\nI just don't know how or when\nSleep on, my lost love on goneEmbed"
