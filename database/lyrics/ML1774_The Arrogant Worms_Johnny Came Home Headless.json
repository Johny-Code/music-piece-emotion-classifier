        "lyrics": "Beetlejuice LyricsFADE IN:\n\nEXT. WINTER RIVER, CONNECTICUT - DAY\n\nA crisp and perfect New England town.  Almost too neat\nto be real.  No visible townspeople.  CAMERA EXPLORES\ntown.\n\n\nCAMERA FLIES\nover a rickety bridge -- PAST the Maitland Hardware and\nAppliance store -- PAST the church -- the Historical\nSociety -- UP over the graveyard on the hill and\nfinally --\n\nTo the Maitland house.  The perfect Victorian house\nsurveying the tiny village.  Suddenly --\n\n\nA GIANT DADDY LONGLEGS SPIDER\n\nmounts the crest of the hill beside the house, pauses to\nwave a spindly leg and then creeps menacingly on top of\nthe Maitland house.\n\nADAM (O.S..)\nWell, well, you're a big fella...!\n\nA hand -- as big as God's -- with a huge tweezer,\ngently reaches down out of the sky and lies, palm up,\nin the yard next to the house.  Daddy Longlegs climbs\ninto it.  The hand rises into the sky again.\n\n\nINT. ATTIC - NEW ANGLE - DAY\nReveals Winter River as a miniature town, while The\nDaddy Longlegs and the hand are normal size.  Above the\nmodel are a homely representation of moon, sun, and\nstars -- a whole, tiny, mechanical universe to track\nthe hours of the day.  A large plat map of the city is\nprominent on the wall.\n\nThe hand is ADAM MAITLAND'S.  In his late 30's, he's a\nsolid easy-going citizen.  Capra used to make movies\nabout him.\n\nAdam's model town sprawls across most of the attic\nspace.  Windows on either end of the attic shed good\nlight into the warm room.  Adam very carefully lifts\nthe spider out the open window.  Smiles as he drips him\nlightly on the breeze.\n\n\nCAMERA TILTS UP FROM THE WINDOW\n\nTo see the real Winter River, laid out exactly as the\nmodel, at the foot of the hill.  Adam breathes deeply\nand looks very pleased at the glorious town below him.\n\n\nON HIS HUGE HAND AGAIN\nas it reaches into model and tweezes a tiny sign into\nthe tiny window of Maitland's Hardware Store on main\nstreet.  It reads:\n\nADAM AND BARBARA MAITLAND\nARE\nON VACATION!\nHOORAY!\n\nAdam leans down and eyes the sign.\n\nBARBARA\n(behind him)\nI'm ready!\n\nAdam turns to see entering:  BARBARA MAITLAND, 35 -- a\nwholesome beauty who is mellowing well.  She smiles at\nhim.  Perhaps a certain tinge of sadness about her,\nbecause they don't have children.\n\nADAM\n(happy to see her)\nShe's ready.\n\nBARBARA\n(eyeing the model)\nIt looks great.\n\nADAM\n(nodding)\nThanks.\n\nShe pushes a wrapped present across the table.\n\nBARBARA\nHappy vacation, honey!\n\nAdam smiles and gives her a present he's hidden under\nthe table.  He opens his present.  A can of furniture\noil.\n\nADAM\nManchurian Tung oil?\n(playfully grabs\nBarbara and kisses\nher)\nWhere did you get it?\n\nBARBARA\nHelen got it for me in Oslo.\nThere's enough to refinish the\ngateleg table and the cherry\nwardrobe...\n\nAdam hands Barbara a carefully-wrapped bundle -- she\nunwraps her gift... rolls of very expensive floral\nwallpaper.  She cradles it in her arms like gold leaf.\n\nBARBARA\nOh, Adam... it's beautiful.\n\nAdam nods, and embraces her.\n\nADAM\nEnough to do the guest room...\n\nBARBARA\n(cooing)\nI'm so glad we're spending our\nvacation at home...\n(with a sudden resolve)\n... I'm going to get started right\nnow!\n\nADAM\n(pulling her back)\nWhoa!... hold on...\n\nBarbara calms down, returning to Adam's embrace... as:\n\nPHONE RINGS -- They freeze, then grin.\n\nADAM & BARBARA\n(unison)\nNo one's home!\n\nHONK HONK outside.  They look at each other horrified.\nPeer out the window.\n\nBARBARA\nOh no.\n\nADAM\n(pointing at her)\nIt's your turn, darling.\n\nShe shakes her head with resignation and goes downstairs.\nKNOCKING on door from below.\n\n\nINT. STAIRCASE AND KITCHEN - DAY\n\nCAMERA FOLLOWS Adam and Barbara downstairs.  We see the\nrambling, old fashioned quality to the house.\n\nClean, sentimental, warm and floral.  Some rooms in\nprogress.  They continue down the main staircase past\nphotos of themselves, old photos of the early days of\nWinter River, pictures and mementos of three\ngenerations in hardware.  Barbara goes to the kitchen\nand Adam continues down to the basement.\n\n\nHER POV - A WOMAN\n\nJANE BUTTERFIELD -- tall, gawky and aggressive peeks in\nthe kitchen door.  She's divorced three husbands and\nburied another for good measure.  She's ruthless but is\nweirdly, seamlessly pleasant.  She waves a legal sized\npaper at them, starts to come inside.\n\n\nINT./EXT. KITCHEN DOOR\n\nBarbara makes dash for it and holds it just as Jane gets\na foot in.  Jane smiles wildly.\n\nJANE\nHi, Barb!  I'm glad I caught you.\nI heard you were on vacation!\n\nBARBARA\nThat's right, Jane.  Complete\nvacation.\n\nJANE\nHoney -- today I am three hundred\nfifty thousand dollars!\n\nBARBARA\nNo!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the\nmorning!\n\nJANE\nLook at me, think of me as cash!\nThis offer is really real!  From a\nrich man in New York City who only\nsaw a photograph!\n(rattles on)\nMy buyer has just made a killing\nin condos in Manhattan, but he's\ngot a little stress problem...\n(taps her head)\n... so -- he wants to bring the\nwife and kid for the old peace and\nquiet.\n\nBARBARA\nThat's what we're looking for,\ntoo.\n\nJANE\nBarbara Maitland, sweetie, just\nlisten now.  This house is too\nbig.  It really ought to be for a\ncouple with a family.\n\nThat hurts Barbara a little.  She looks at Jane.\n\nJANE\n(continuing)\nOh, honey... I didn't mean\nanything... it's just too big for\nyou.\n\nJane compulsively affixes her business card, face inside.\nin the windowpane.\n\nBARBARA\n(shutting door)\n'Bye, Jane, see you in a few\nweeks.\n\n\nADAM\n\nis humming happily, looking for paint brushes in the\nground floor storeroom.  He spies a cassette deck and\nlooks through a stack of cassettes and plays one.  It\nis an old INKSPOTS LOVE SONG.\n\n\nINT. GUEST ROOM - DAY\n\nBarbara is starting to paper the walls already.  She\nfrowns at the MUSIC.  Goes to the door.\n\nBARBARA\nOh, honey.  You said no Inkspots\non this vacation!\n\nIt CLICKS OFF.  She goes back into the room.\n\n\nINT. STOREROOM - DAY\n\nAdam puts away the tape but keeps humming the song.  He\nopens the shutters on a small window.  ON WINDOW...\n\nJANE\n(her huge face\ngrinning at him)\nBoo!\n\nHe jumps back, frightened.\n\nADAM\nNo, Jane.\n\nAdam closes the shutters as Jane affixes yet another\ncard to the window.  He continues his search for a\nbrush.\n\n\nJANE\n\nexits jauntily, flapping her contract down the lawn.\n\n\nINT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY\n\nAdam continues rummaging for a brush.  Can't find it.\n\nADAM\n(calling to distant\nBarbara)\nHoney, come with me down to the\nstore?\n\nBARBARA (O.S.)\nWhat for?\n\nADAM\nI need a good brush for this Tung\noil and I want to pick up a piece\nof the model.  Let's go early\nbefore anyone sees us.\n\nBarbara has already papered a few rolls in the guest\nroom.\n\nBARBARA\nOkay, but let's hurry back.  You\njust run in okay?\n\n\nEXT. THE HOUSE - DAY\n\nThe Victorian house from the model \"in the flesh.\"\nAdam stands by the station wagon.\n\nOn the bumper of the car is a sticker reading:\nWARNING:  I BRAKE FOR ANIMALS.\n\nBarbara gets in driver's side.  They drive off.\n\n\nINT. THE CAR - DAY\n\nAdam dusts the inside of the dashboard.  Clean Clean.\n\nBARBARA\n(preoccupied)\nJane said we should sell the house\nto someone with a family.\n\nADAM\nAh, the ever-tactful Jane.\n\nPuts his hand on her shoulder.\n\n\nEXT. THE RIVER AND BRIDGE AND HILL - DAY\n\nWe see the car coming down the hill toward the bridge.\n\nADAM (V.O.)\nWe should be flattered that she\nwants to sell our house.\n\nBARBARA (V.O.)\nI know... I just wish she'd leave\nus alone.\n\nADAM (V.O.)\nLet's not think about it.  We'll\nhave a nice romantic, quiet,\nvacation.  Here comes the bridge\nchorus.\n\nCar reaches the rickety covered bridge.  Car shakes,\nbobbing up and down on every plank.\n\nON Barbara and Adam TIGHT -- (they've done this routine\nbefore).  They sing an old Johnny Mathis song.  With a\nlot of vibrato.\n\nTOGETHER\nChances are... When I wear a\nfoolish grin...\n\nThey laugh.\n\n\nEXT. DOWNTOWN WINTER RIVER - DAY\n\nJust like the model, but real.  And populated.\n\nCAMERA PAUSES ON a gorgeous storefront with a brass\nlion out front.  Sign above doors says --\n\nBOZMAN BUILDING 1835\n\nAn old man polishes the lion as Maitlands drive by and\nwave.\n\nBARBARA (V.O.)\nWave at the lion.\n\nADAM (V.O.)\nDon't forget the balls, Ernie.\n\nBARBARA (V.O.)\n(embarrassed)\nAdam!\n\nErnie looks around to see no one's looking and polishes\nthe balls of the lion.\n\n\nCAMERA SPIES A JAUNTY DOG\n\nlike Benji, peeing on the opposite corner of the lion.\nMaitlands drive by store with sign:\n\nJANE BUTTERFIELD\nANTIQUES\nREAL ESTATE\nTRAVEL\n\n\nINT. ANTIQUE STORE REAL ESTATE OFFICE TRAVEL AGENCY -\nDAY\n\nThe store is bursting with antiques of all sorts,\ntravel brochures, photographs of houses for sale, and a\nserve-yourself Xerox machine.  LITTLE JANE, her eight-\nyear-old daughter is drudgingly making copies.\n\nJane, phone in hand, rushes to the window to watch\nMaitlands drive by.  Almost popping the cord when it\nreaches its end.  She's waiting for the other party to\npick up.\n\nJANE\nY... ello.  Mrs. Deetz?  Well the\ncondition is what we country folk\ncall, fixin'... Yes, I think they\nare fixin' to accept another\noffer.  Well maybe if you offer\n390,000 they'll take it.\n\n\nEXT. MAITLAND HARDWARE - DAY\n\nAdam sprints up the steps of his lovely hardware store.\nOLD BILL, a slightly-addled ancient barber, is napping\nin a chair in front of his shop, next door to Adam's.\nAdam fumbles with the lock, not interested in conver-\nsation.  He drops his keys, waking Old Bill.\n\nOLD BILL\n'Morning, Adam.  You need a\nhaircut before your vacation?\n\nADAM\nNo thanks, Bill.\n\nOLD BILL\nHow's the model coming?\n\nADAM\nGood, Bill -- Good.\n\nBill turns around and continues prattling even though\nAdam has entered.  Bill prattles throughout.\n\nOLD BILL\nY'know, I was thinkin'... you said\nBozman built the foundation in\n1835 but y'know his grandson came\nin here last week and said he\nfound a bottle with an 1836 stamp\nin it plastered in the foundation.\n(suddenly disgusted\nat the memory)\nHe's got hair down to his\ngoddamned shoulders...\n\n\nINT. MAITLAND HARDWARE\n\nAdam pulls down a few good paintbrushes and carefully\npicks up a small model of the Bozman building.  He\nwalks out.  Old Bill continues unabated.\n\nOLD BILL\nHe said \"Just give me a trim...\" I\ntook a scissors to him so fast...\nwould've skimmed him clean if he\nhadn't...\n\nAdam strides by quickly to the car.\n\nADAM\nSee you, Bill.\n\nOLD BILL\nRight.\n\n\nEXT. MAITLAND'S CAR - DAY\n\nThe Maitlands drive their car out of town.\n\n\nON JANE\n\n\nEXT. CAR AND BRIDGE - DAY\n\nCar approaches.\n\n\nINT. CAR - DAY\n\nFive brushes sit on the seat next to Adam.  He cradles\nsmall replica of the Bozman building, complete with\nbrass lion.\n\nBARBARA\nIt's a beauty.\n\nADAM\nYeah it turned out okay.  We\napplied for a historical plaque\nfor it.  That'll be the third one\non Main Street.\n\nBARBARA\n(jokingly)\nWith all these historical\nlandmarks in town, where are they\ngoing to put the condominiums?\n\nADAM\n(grinning)\nSlow down there, honey... I don't\nwant the vibration to weaken the\nmodel.\n\nBARBARA\n(nervous)\nOh... I'm sorry...\n\nBarbara starts to apply the brakes.\n\nJust before the bridge the dog waddles out in the road.\nStops to pee.  Barbara swerves.  As the car hits the\nrickety bridge, the speed is just a bit too much.\n\nBoards RATTLE and loosen, the car skews and catches in\nan open slot, careens to the right, then the left and\nthe bridge.\n\n\nINT. CAR - DAY\n\nA piling has smashed through the window on the pas-\nsenger side, crushing the upper part of Barbara's\narm.  She is wailing in pain and fright.\n\nAdam tries to help Barbara.  He tries to get out of the\ncar.  None of this succeeds.\n\n\nEXT. BRIDGE AND RIVER - DAY\n\nThe dog finishes, looks over at the car, walks across\nthe bridge and steps on the one board which holds the\ncar aloft.\n\nThe car rocks back and forth for a moment, and then\nslides forward toward the water.\n\n\nEXT. CAR AND BRIDGE\n\nThe car plunges into the rushing water.  It floats\nfor a moment, and then sinks like a stone.\n\nFADE TO BLACK.\n\n\nFADE IN:\n\nINT. BARBARA AND ADAM'S LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\nQuiet, still, expectant.  There is a fire laid in the\nhearth.  Suddenly and for no apparent reason it ignites\nand burns with a furious cheerfulness.\n\nBarbara and Adam enter, dazed, wet, and bedraggled.\n\nBARBARA\nSomething like this always happens\nwhen we try to go on vacation.\nAlways.\n\nAdam leads her toward the fire.\n\nADAM\nYou'll feel better when you're\ndry.\n\nHe holds out his hands to be warmed.  Barbara comes up\nbeside him.  All this time she's been holding her\ninjured arm with the other hand.\n\nBARBARA\nThis fire wasn't burning when we\nleft the house.\n\nADAM\nHow's your arm?\n\nBARBARA\nI'm not sure.  It feels... frozen.\n\nShe holds her arms out to warm them.  One hand catches\non fire.\n\n\nBARBARA'S LEFT ARM\n\nThey stare at it dumbfoundedly before Adam regains his\nsenses and snatches it out of the fire.  Two of the\nfingers are burning like candles, and Barbara indus-\ntriously blows them out.\n\nBARBARA\nOh, Adam.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM:  A FEW MINUTES LATER - DAY\n\nThey are sitting on the couch together.  Barbara is\nlooking away slightly -- as one does when a doctor is\ndrawing blood -- while Adam looks at her fingers.  He\nfrowns.\n\nHe looks at his skin.  It is pale.  He looks at\nBarbara.\n\nADAM\nYou'd better sit down, hon.\n\nBARBARA\nI am sitting.\n\nADAM\nI'll tell you what, Barbara.  I\ndon't think we survived that\ncrash.\n\nBARBARA\n(pause)\nOh, Adam.  We're home.  In our own\nhouse.  Nonsense.  I'll make some\ncoffee.  You get some more\nfirewood.\n\nAdam gets up, a little absently, she follows him as he\nwanders to the front door.  He peers out.\n\nADAM\nLet's take things extra slow.  Do\nyou remember how we got back up\nhere?\n\nBarbara tests her hand, clenches and unclenches her\nfist.\n\nBARBARA\nI'm fine.  My arm works fine.\n\nAdam, exploring, opens the door, steps out on the front\nporch.\n\n\nEXT. FRONT PORCH - TWILIGHT\n\nAdam's face is painted with color of sunset.  He stands\natop the steps leading down to the front yard.  Barbara\nstands just inside the open threshold, looking out\nworriedly.\n\nBARBARA\n(quiet sarcasm)\nThe end of a perfect day.\n\nAdam starts to step down to the yard.\n\nADAM\nHoney, I'm gonna go down to the\nbridge and retrace our steps.\n\nHe steps off the last step into the yard and promptly\ndisappears.\n\nBARBARA\nAdam!\n\n\nEXT. THE GREAT VOID\n\nAdam is nowhere.  There's no ground, no sky, nothing to\nstand on or hold onto or give boundaries or distance.\nJust vast nothing.  Not white and not colored either.\nNOISE OF A CLOCK TICKING.\n\nAdam looks about surprised, doesn't like what he\ndoesn't see.  He turns around to head back up the\nsteps.  There are no steps.\n\nADAM\nBarbara?\n\nHis VOICE ECHOES STRANGELY.  He runs off a little in\nthe distance, and calls again from over there.\n\nADAM\n(continuing; quietly)\nWhere are you?\n\nHe goes even farther away.\n\n\nIN THE FOREGROUND\n\nan enormous geared wheel -- the size of a man -- rolls\nby, tearing up the unseamed ground.  Something pours up\nout of the tear -- ooze or stuffing.\n\nAdam runs forward and stares after the wheel, which is\nnow out of sight.\n\n\nTWO SMALLER GEARS\n\nlooking very much like components of a giant watch --\nspin along behind him.  One of them veers suddenly\ntoward him, and though Adam jumps out of the way, the\ngear snags his trouser leg and shreds it.  LOUD\nTICKING.\n\n\nA PERFECTLY ENORMOUS GEAR\n\ncomes barreling toward him.  Adam leaps out of its\nway.  The gear turns, fish-tailing, kicking up ooze and\nstuffing.\n\nAdam flings himself suddenly to the right, but trips\ninto the path of the gear.  As he's about to be\ncrushed, he's suddenly jerked up to safety.\n\n\nEXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT\n\nIt's Barbara who's grabbed him, and quite evidently\nsaved his life -- not life, perhaps -- but existence.\nHe's shaken, breathless.\n\nBarbara stares at him, as if wondering what he's just\nbeen through.\n\nADAM\n(weakly)\nYou saved my -- uh -- life... or\nwhatever...\n\nBARBARA\nTwo hours.\n\nADAM\nWhat?\n\nBARBARA\nThat's how long you were gone.\n\nADAM\n(pondering that)\n... Hmmm?\n\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nBarbara leads Adam into the house.\n\nADAM\nAnything happen while I was away?\n\nBARBARA\nYes, it did.  Yes, it did.  I made\na couple of small discoveries.\n\n\nBARBARA\n\nstands by the mirror over the hearth mantle.  On the\nmantle is Barbara's prize collection of porcelain\nhorses.  Adam comes to stand beside her.  They look\ninto the mirror, and there is no reflection of them.\n\nBarbara picks up one of the horses, and trots it through\nthe air.  The horse is imaged in the mirror.\n\nBARBARA\n(continuing)\nThere's that, and there's this.\n\nShe picks up an ancient, leather-bound book.  It's\nyellow and worn, about the size of the Boy Scout\nmanual.\n\nCLOSEUP:  Its title is HANDBOOK FOR THE RECENTLY\nDECEASED.\n\nADAM\n(reading)\nHandbook for the recently\ndiseased.\n\nBARBARA\nDeceased.  I don't know where it\ncame from.  Look at the publisher.\n\nADAM\n(he does and reads)\nHandbook for the Recently Deceased\nPress.\n\nBARBARA\n(finally admit-\nting it)\nI don't think we survived the\ncrash.\n\n\nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nAdam is already in bed, reading from the handbook.\nBarbara is getting ready for bed -- going through a\nritual of sorts that they practiced every night of\ntheir married lives.\n\nBARBARA\nI don't like situations like this.\nI hate it when I'm not in control.\nSo just tell me the basics.\n\nADAM\nThis book isn't arranged that\nway.  What do you want to know?\n\nBARBARA\nThere are a thousand things... Why\ndid you disappear when you walked\noff the front porch?  Is this a\npunishment?  Are we halfway to\nheaven or are we halfway to hell?\nAnd how long is this going to\nlast?\n\nADAM\nI don't see anything about\n\"Rewards and Punishments\" or\n\"Heaven and Hell.\"\n(frustrated)\nThis book reads like stereo\ninstructions!  Listen to this...\n'Geographical and Temporal\nPerimeters... Functional\nperimeters vary from manifestation\nto manifestation.\"  This is going\nto take some time.\n\n\nBARBARA\n\npaces, she trips on her wallpaper rolls.  Kicks them.\n\nBARBARA\nI knew I'd never finish the guest\nroom.  Adam, we just can't stay in\nhere forever!\n\nThey look at each other, the question hangs in the air.\nCan't they?\n\nAdam stands and walks to the window.\n\nADAM\n(thoughtfully)\nMaybe we should set up a normal\nroutine.\n\nShe looks at him like he's nuts.\n\nADAM\n(continuing)\nI mean, let's try to nail down\nsomething in our lives.  A regular\nschedule.  We can keep track of\ntime and go on with our projects\nup here in the attic.\n\nShe shakes her head, exasperated.  Flops down on the\nbed.\n\nBARBARA\nOh, God, maybe this is all just a\nbad dream.\n\nON ADAM - TIGHT - a somber look comes across his face.\n\nADAM\nI'm afraid not, honey.\n\nBarbara looks up at him, questioningly.\n\nBARBARA\nWhy?  What's wrong?  Adam?\n\nShe stands and joins him at the window.\n\n\nTHEIR POV THROUGH THE WINDOW\n\nIn the distance we see an automobile funeral procession\nthreading its way toward the nearby cemetery.  Head-\nlights are on.  We recognize Jane's car in the line.\n\n\nREVERSE ON BARBARA AND ADAM\n\nsomber faces.\n\n\nTIGHTER ON PROCESSION\n\nIt arrives at the gravesite.  We see some familiar\nfaces, Ernie, and Old Bill the Barber.  Jane and little\nJane watch as two identical coffins are carried to-\ngether, to two open graves.\n\n\nON BARBARA AND ADAM\n\nShe drops her head sadly on his shoulder.  He leans his\nface slightly into hers.\n\nFADE OUT.\n\n\nFADE IN:\n\nINT. ATTIC - DAY\n\nAdam is setting up a small monument in the model town\ncemetery.  It reads:  ADAM AND BARBARA MAITLAND/UNITED\nIN LIFE/UNDIVIDED IN DEATH.\n\nADAM\nI wish I had a better view of the\ncemetery from up here.  I don't\nknow which area is the best\nplacement for us.\n\nBarbara, trying to clean, lets out a frustrated YELP!\nShe paces.\n\nADAM\n(continuing)\nCabin fever, han?\n\nBARBARA\nI can't clean anything.  The\nvacuum is out in the garage.  I\ncan't leave the house.  Why don't\nthey tell us something?  Where are\nall the other dead people in the\nworld?  Why is it just you and me?\n\nADAM\nMaybe this is heaven.\n\nBARBARA\n(looking at the\ndusty walls)\nIn heaven there wouldn't be dust\non the wallpaper.\n\nADAM\nHon... I didn't want to die, but\nreally, this is fine with me.\nLook, we never have to wash dishes\nagain.\n\nBARBARA\nDishes?  We haven't eaten in three\nweeks!  Adam, I'm not like you.  I\nreally need to be around people,\nget out to the church and go\ngrocery shopping.\n\nADAM\nBut I'm not hungry, are you?\n\nBarbara shakes her head and picks up the Handbook and\npages through it desperately.\n\nBARBARA\nI keep having this feeling that\nsomething has got to happen.\n\nCAR DOOR SLAMS outside.  Adam and Barbara look at one\nanother.  Run to window.\n\n\nEXT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY\n\nJane Butterfield is staring up at the old house.\n\n\nINT. ATTIC - DAY\n\nAdam, from his angle, can just barely see her.\n\nADAM\nGod, it's Jane.\n\nBARBARA\nWhat's she doing here?\n\nADAM\nI don't know.\n(shouting)\nJane, Jane, up here!\n\n\nEXT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY\n\nUnhearing, Jane heads for car.  SOUND OF WIND UP.\nBlows her dress.  Little Jane straggles along with her\nlike an apprentice.\n\n\nINT. ATTIC - DAY\n\nBarbara watches Adam, and shakes her head.  He stops.\n\nBARBARA\nShe can't see you, right?\n\nAdam nods.\n\nBARBARA\n(continuing)\nIn the book, Rule Number Two:  the\nliving usually won't see the dead.\n\nADAM\nWon't?  Or can't?\n\nBARBARA\nJust says \"won't.\"  Wait a minute.\nHere it says \"the living are\narrogant... they think they'll\nnever die, so they refuse to see\nthe dead.\"\n\nADAM\nArrogant.  That's Jane all right...\n\nBarbara sighs and nods.\n\nBARBARA\nAt least we won't have to worry\nabout her.\n\nAdam smiles and goes to his model.\n\n\nEXT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY\n\nJane drives away.  CAMERA HINGES to see a FOR SALE\nsign.  Across it -- another smaller banner.  It reads:\nSOLD!\n\nCUT TO:\n\n\nINT. MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING\n\nThe Maitlands are asleep.  CAMERA EXPLORES the room a\nbit.  It is getting slightly tatty.  Adam rolls over,\npulling the covers off Barbara.  We see:\n\nON BARBARA -- she is hovering off the side of the bed.\n\nAn OMINOUS RUMBLE -- like a 4.0 earthquake shakes\nthe house.  GLASS RATTLES, the ceramic horses on the\nmantelpiece jump around.  Barbara falls to the floor.\nThey look at one another with horror.  They leap up and\nrun downstairs.\n\n\nINT.  LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\nThe RUMBLE BUILDS TO A CLIMAX, there is a LOUD METALLIC\nSQUEAL, and then a CRASH... just as Barbara and Adam\narrive.\n\n\nTHE FRONT DOOR\n\nsmashes open revealing a moving van ramp.\n\n\nA TEN-FOOT ELECTRIC-BLUE ITALIAN LEATHER COUCH\n\nslides smoothly down the ramp.  On the couch sits DELIA\nDEETZ.\n\nThe couch CRASHES into the base of the staircase,\nsmashing the newel post and several of the balusters.\nBarbara cringes.  One of the balusters falls at Delia's\nside.  She grasps it like a scepter.\n\nTwo MOVING MEN rush down the ramp.\n\nMOVING MAN #1\nSorry about that, Mrs. Deetz.\n\nDELIA\nDon't worry.  It was going anyway.\n\nDelia is relentlessly New York, relentlessly fashion-\nable, relentlessly thin -- totally self assured.\n\nShe is also a woman with a mission -- to gut Barbara\nand Adam's house and remake it in her own very upscale\nimage.\n\nDelia's gaze is on the living room, but she looks\nthrough Adam and Barbara as if they weren't even there\n(which to her eyes they're not).\n\nStill holding the baluster, Delia gets up off the couch\nand moves into the living room, surveying it with an\nodd mixture of ambition, and resolution.\n\n\nBEHIND HER\n\nthe two Moving Men bring in a matching blue leather\narmchair.  In the armchair sits LYDIA DEETZ.\n\nLydia, age 14, is a pretty girl, but wan, pale and\noverly-dramatic, dressed as she is in her favorite\ncolor, black.  She's a combination of a little death\nrocker and an 80's version of Edward Gorey's little\ngirls.\n\nShe has a couple of expensive cameras around her neck\n-- and is already taking photographs of the moving\nmen.  Lydia is cool, Lydia is sullen, Lydia is her\nfather's daughter by his first marriage.  Lydia is\nusually about half-pissed off.  But underneath... we\nlike her a lot.\n\nThe Moving Men still hold up the chair, waiting for\nDelia to decide where she wants it.\n\nDELIA\n(continuing)\nJesus.  Who lived here?  The\nWaltons?\n\nTIGHT ON Lydia -- calmly surveys the house.\n\nDelia signals wearily that the Moving Men can put the\nchair down anywhere.\n\nDELIA\n(continuing)\nGet all this other crap out of\nhere.\n\nLydia hops down out of the chair, and comes farther\ninto the living room.\n\nDELIA\n(continuing)\nWhere is your father?... probably\nin the kitchen.\n\nThat's the cue for CHARLES DEETZ, who comes in through\nthe swinging door, and across the dining room... a ner-\nvous but basically pleasant man, CHARLES DEETZ is\nintent on attacking rest and relaxation with the same\nvengeance that earned him millions in real estate.\n\nCHARLES\nThe noise in that kitchen.  Noisy\nrefrigerator, noisy faucets...\nWe'll have to replace it all.  I\nwant no humming in the house.\n\n\nLYDIA\n\nexploring on her own, gazes around the living room with\ngrowing pleasure, she backs up for a good angle to\nphotograph.\n\nCAMERA HINGES -- She is standing with her back right up\nto Barbara -- who is horrified at this creature.\n\nCharles enters.\n\nCHARLES\n(to Lydia)\nWhat do you think, honey?\n\nLYDIA\nDelia hates it.\n\nLydia gazes at a dusty maze of spider webs.\n\nLYDIA\n(continuing)\nI could live here.\n\nA movement makes Lydia turn around and scream.  It is\nDelia.  Not Barbara.\n\nDELIA\nSettle down, Lydia.  I wonder\nwhere we are going to get\ncounseling for you out here.\n\nA VIOLENT FALSETTO SCREAM turns the Deetz family's\nattention to the front windows.\n\nOTHO (O.S.)\nHelp!  Oh help!\n\n\nOTHO'S MASSIVE BODY\n\nWedged in the window frame.  The short, stubby legs,\ndressed in the world's largest pair of Georgia Armani\nslacks, protrude into the living room, waving fran-\ntically.  Expensive Italian loafers are kicked off the\nfeet, revealing a pair of expensive patterned socks.\nBy their feet shall ye know them.\n\nDELIA\nIt's Otho!\n\nCHARLES\nOtho, why didn't you just come in\nthe door?\n\nOtho's voice comes as if from a great distance.\n\nOTHO (O.S.)\nIt's bad luck.  And I believe\nhugely in luck.\n\nDELIA\nHold your breath and we'll pull.\n\nDelia turns to Charles and Lydia for help -- doesn't\nget it -- and at last pulls Otho into the living room\nsingle-handedly.\n\nAll this while the Moving Men are variously carting out\nthe handsome old furniture and bringing in the hideous\nnew furniture.\n\nOtho is Robert Morley at his most obscenely fat and\nfaggoty.  But he's not all fat and fun -- this customer\ncarries nasty emotional weight as well.\n\n\nOTHO\n\nholds onto the curtains for support as he is pulled\nthrough the window.  And when he is at last all the way\nthrough, and upright on his feet, he suddenly gives a\ntremendous yank.  The whole drapery apparatus,\nincluding valences, crashes to the floor.\n\nOTHO\nThat was the single most\nunattractive window treatment I\nhave ever seen in the entire of my\nexistence.\n\nDELIA\n(starry eyed)\nI'm so glad you could leave the\ncity to consult me, Otho.\n\nOtho is looking around the room with an eye of quiet\nhorror.\n\nOTHO\nYes, of course you are.  Well,\nOtho had an intuition.  Call it a\nhunch -- that it was going to be a\nfabled monstrosity of a house.\nAnd it certainly is.  Charles,\nyou're lucky the yuppies are\nbuying condos, so you can afford\nwhat I'm going to have to do to\nthis place.  We are talking from\nthe ground ups'ville!\n\nCHARLES\nThat's fine, Otho.  Just keep me\nout of it.  I am here to relax and\nclip coupons.  And goddamnit, I\nmean to do it.\n\nHe exits to find solace in a quiet corner of his house.\nDuring this speech, Otho has been surreptitiously pos-\ning for Lydia's camera.  She clicks the shutter.\n\nOTHO\n(ignoring her)\nIs the rest of the house as bad as\nthis?\n\nDELIA\nThe rest of the house is probably\nworse.  When can you and I get\nstarted?\n\nOTHO\nNo time like the present, as my\nwicked stepmother used to say.\n\nOut of the pockets of his size 56 Georgia Armani\njacket, Otho takes two cans of spray paint -- the kind\nthe graffiti artists use -- and shakes them as if they\nwere castanets.  They certainly sound like it.\n\nOTHO\nDelia, let's get this show on the\nroad.\n\n\nINT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY\n\nAt one end, near the stairs leading up to the attic,\nBarbara and Adam are slumped against opposite walls.\n\nBARBARA\nAdam, we are in hell.  I hate\nthese people.\n\nADAM\nThey make Jane look good.\n\nBARBARA\nIs this a punishment for something\nwe did in life?  What can we do?\n\nADAM\n(determined)\nWe're not completely helpless.\nI've been reading the book.\nThere's a word for people in our\npredicament, honey.\n\nBarbara looks at him.\n\nBARBARA\n(continuing)\nGhosts!\n\nBarbara is shocked at the reality.\n\nOtho and Delia come up the stairs at the end of the\nhallway.\n\nOTHO\nWe're dealing with negative\nentertainment potential here.  I\nmean, there's absolutely no organic\nwalking flow-through.\n\nOtho looks down the hallway.  It's empty.  Adam and\nBarbara are no longer there.\n\nDELIA\nWhat's wrong?\n\nOTHO\nI thought I saw something.\n\nDeLia turns and spray-paints on the wall -- in luminous\norange -- the word MAUVE.\n\nDELIA\nOkay?\n\nOTHO\n(screaming with delight)\nYou read my mind!  I love clients\nwho can read my mind.  I don't\nthink people realize how strong a\nconnection there is between\ninterior design and the\nsupernatural.\n\nDELIA\n(fawning)\nI know... I read your book, The\nHaunted Tapestries of the Waldorf.\n\nOTHO\nGooood!\n\nDelia opens the door and they step inside another room.\n\nDELIA\nThis will be Lydia's room.\n\n\nINT. LYDIA'S ROOM - DAY\n\nIt's not Lydia's room yet, of course, because it still\nhas the Maitlands' furniture in it.  Barbara had partly\nwallpapered it before the accident.  Her tools are still\nthere.\n\nDELIA\nWhat do you think?\n\nOTHO\nViridian?\n\nDELIA\nViridian?  What is...?\n\nOtho spray-paints the word VIRIDIAN on the wall -- plus\nthe word BLUE GREEN -- and Cr2 03, right over a picture\nof Adam and Barbara as kids.\n\nOTHO\nBlue-green!  Hydrated chromic\noxide!  Remember I'm schooled in\nchemistry.  I was a hair analyst!\nBriefly.  Interior design is a\nscience, Delia!  Think of me as\nDoctor Otho.\n(looking at wall)\nAnd this patient is truly sick!\n\nDELIA\nOf course, her favorite color!\nHow beautiful!\n\nDelia smiles.  Behind Delia and Otho, the room's closet\ndoor swings slowly open with and ominous CREAK.\n\n\nDELIA AND OTHO\n\nturn that way, with a suggestion of dread.  Inside the\ncloset, Barbara's corpse is suspended from the ceiling\nby a belt.  The corpse twists with a CREAK, and Barbara\ngrins ghostly -- and slowly tears off her face, leaving\nnothing but muscle and bone beneath.  Her eyeballs\ndangle on her cheeks.\n\nDelia and Otho stare aghast.\n\nDELIA\nOh my God!\n\nOTHO\nWe just have to pray that the\nother closets are bigger than this\none.\n\nHe walks over.  Looks inside.\n\nOTHO\n(continuing)\nWere these people dwarfes? (sic)\n(spies something)\nOooooo!...  Look!\n\nHe finds, neatly hung in plastic, the Maitlands'\nwedding outfits.  Totally captivated by this powerful\nimage, he peers through the plastic at them.  Holding\neach up to Delia.  Barbara watches wide-eyed at them.\n\nOTHO\n(continuing)\nOzzie...\n(holding up\nher dress)\n... and... Harriet!  What happened\nto these people?\n\nDelia slams the door in Barbara's contorted face.\n\nDELIA\nThey died.\n\n\nINT. HOUSE - SAME TIME\n\nDelia and Otho come out of Lydia's bedroom and go\nthrough the bathroom.  Disgusted, they continue on to\nthe study.\n\n\nOTHO\n\nreaches out and turns the knob.  The door swings omi-\nnously open on Charles' study.  This had been Adam's\nreading and birdwatching study.  Bird posters on the\nwall, books everywhere.  Straight out of Better Homes\nand Gardens 1963.\n\nOTHO\nOoo.  Deliver me from L.L. Bean!\n\n\nANGLE\n\nThere is one slight difference, however, because on the\nrag rug in the middle of the floor lies Adam's headless\ncorpse.  Standing over him, holding in one hand a long\nknife and in the other Adam's blood-and-gore dripping\nhead is Barbara -- with a maniacal look on her face.\nBehind them, Charles is thumbing through Adam's Audubon\ncollection.  He sits up like a cornered animal protect-\ning his territory.\n\nCHARLES\n(to Otho and Delia)\nThis room is off limits.  I don't\nwant either of you to touch one\npiece of furniture in here.  This\nis my room.\n\n\nINSIDE THE ROOM\n\nThe eyes of Adam's severed head open and look up at\nBarbara -- she stops screaming.\n\nADAM'S HEAD\nThey don't see us.  They can't\nhear us.\n\nOutside, Delia is shaking her head.\n\nDELIA\nThe woman who lived here had the\naesthetic instincts of Betty\nCrocker.\n\nBARBARA\nI'm going to get her.\n\nDELIA\nI cannot convey to you the extent\nto which this house bores me.\n\nOTHO\n(looking around\nscientifically)\nOnce you cover up the wallpaper,\nknock down a few walls, alter the\ntraffic patterns, and -- perhaps\n-- think about an inground pool --\nthe place might just be livable.\nWhat's on the third floor?\n\nDELIA\nAttic space.\n\nOTHO\nLet's see.  We could turn that\ninto a media room.\n\nThey head up the stars to the attic.\n\n\nINT. STUDY - SAME TIME\n\nAdam's head has a look of terror on it.\n\nADAM'S HEAD\nOh, God.  I forgot to lock the\nattic door!\n\nAdam's headless body jumps up off the floor and rushes\nout of the room.\n\n\nINT. STAIRCASE TO ATTIC - SAME TIME\n\nOtho and Delia climbing.  The headless corpse careens\npast them, around the bend in the stairs and out of\nsight.\n\nOTHO\nDid you feel something?\n\nDelia shakes her head.\n\nOTHO\n(continuing)\nI felt a cool wind.\n\nThe expression on Otho's face suggests he knows more\nthan he's telling.\n\n\nINT. LANDING OUTSIDE ATTIC DOOR - SAME TIME\n\nThe headless corpse rushes through the open door into\nthe attic.\n\n\nINT. ATTIC - SAME TIME\n\nThe headless corpse slams the door shut, turns the key\nin the lock.  Then he slumps against the locked door in\nan exaggerated stance of relief.\n\n\nINT. ATTIC LANDING - SAME TIME\n\nDelia tries the knob.  The door is locked.\n\nOTHO\nYou don't have a key?\n\nDELIA\nMaybe Charles does.\n\nOTHO\nI have a feeling there's some very\ninteresting space behind this\ndoor.\n\nDELIA\n(sarcastic)\nProbably the world's largest\nReader's Digest collection!\nC'mon, let's have some chablis,\nOtho, I'm laid bare by this\nexperience.  Entirely bare.\n\n\nINT. STUDY - SAME TIME\n\nBarbara still holding Adam's head.\n\nCharles still calmly leafing through the Audubons.\n\nADAM'S HEAD\nWhew!  That was close.\n\nBARBARA\nI cannot witness this.\n\nBarbara distractedly puts Adam's head on a bookshelf.\nHis headless body fumbles with the books and finally\nreattaches the head.\n\n\nINT. STUDY - DAY\n\nAdam turns away from the window.\n\nBarbara, fuming, moves around Charles making wild\ngestures.\n\nBARBARA\nWhat's the good of being a ghost\nif you can't frighten people to\ndeath?\n\nADAM\nOh, honey...\n\nBARBARA\nNo, I'm not putting up with this.\n\nShe storms out of the room.\n\n\nINT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER\n\nBarbara storms in, as if straight from the room up-\nstairs.  She heads straight for the back door.  Just as\nshe opens the door, Adam rushes up.\n\nADAM\nBarbara, honey!  Don't go out\nthere.  You don't know --\n\nBARBARA\nNothing can be worse than this...\n\nShe flings open the door and steps outside.  She\npromptly disappears.\n\nADAM\nBarbara!\n\n\nEXT. SURFACE OF SATURN'S MOON TITAN - DAY\n\nBarbara plunges into the dusty surface of Titan with an\nenormous Saturn looming in the sky.  She looks around\nwith wonder and some fear.\n\n\nA SULFUR VOLCANO\n\nerupts in the distance.  A meteor CRASHES with a lurid\nEXPLOSION.  As from a great distance she hears Adam's\nVOICE.  Like THUNDER.\n\nADAM\nBarbara!\n\nShe turns slowly in the yellow dense sand that covers\nthe surface of this distant moon.\n\n\nBARBARA'S POV\n\nAdam is trudging towards her.  Behind him, hovering\nisolated in the air, is the kitchen door.\n\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nAdam at last catches up with her.  Surveys around them.\n\nBARBARA\nOh Adam.  Find somebody.  I'm\ngetting all yellow.  Do something!\n\n\nBEHIND THEM\n\nSomething is burrowing rapidly toward them through the\nsand.  The Something could be right out of \"Dune\".\n\n\nBARBARA AND ADAM\n\nstare for a moment, then Adam grabs her and pulls her\ntoward the kitchen door.  But the kitchen door has\nmoved, so they veer in the new direction.\n\nThe Something follows them and rises out of the sand.\n\n\nON SOMETHING\n\nIt is a very big, very nasty, and very hungry SNAPPING\nSANDWORM.  It ROARS and lunges at them.\n\n\nBARBARA\n\nslightly angered at it, instinctively bats at it.\n\n\nTHE SANDWORM\n\nis momentarily stunned at Barbara's audacity.  It\nfreezes and shakes its loathesome head.\n\n\nBARBARA\n\nbats at it again.  Adam is wide-eyed, tries to pull her\naway.  The Sandworm recovers and ROARS after them.\n\n\nADAM\n\ngrabs Barbara and tries to escape, but they slip and\nsink in the sand.\n\nThey make it to the door just in time, swing it open\nand hurl themselves through.  The door shuts with a\nBANG just in front of the ROARING SANDWORM.\n\nTHE SANDWORM\n\nrears and ROARS in frustration, HOWLING to the ringed\nplanet.\n\n\nINT. KITCHEN\n\nBarbara, weeping, throws herself in Adam's arms.\n\nBARBARA\nOh, Adam, don't ever leave me\nalone.\n\nADAM\nYou left me.\n\nBARBARA\nI know.  I'm sorry.\n\nShe hugs him tight.\n\nBARBARA\n(continuing)\nI just realized that I could have\nbeen killed alone.  Don't ever\nleave me, honey.\n\nBoth contemplate that horror.\n\nBARBARA\n(continuing)\nWe're trapped in this house\nforever... with those... people.\n\nADAM\nYou can't say that for sure.  It\ncould be a transitional thing.\nLike a post-life crisis.  We just\nhave to be tougher with them.\nCome on.  Have some brandy.\nSpirits?\n\nBARBARA\n(a tentative smile)\nDeath didn't improve your sense of\nhumor.\n\nThey head for the dining room.\n\n\nINT. DINING ROOM\n\nAdam has his arms around Barbara's shoulder.  They walk\nin the door and stumble upon the Deetzes at their\ndinner.  Lydia's back is to them.  Barbara and Adam\nback out of the room but stop to listen.\n\n\nINT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nThe Deetz's around the dining room table.  There are\ncandles and good china laid out-- but they're eating\nout of Chinese take-out boxes.\n\nDELIA\nI can't believe that we're eating\nCantonese.  Is there no Szechuan\nup here?  Hunan?\n\nCHARLES\nThere's only one Chinese\nrestaurant out here, darling, the\nowners are Irish and Irish people\nhappen to cook Cantonese.  They\ndon't know better.\n\nLYDIA\nI plan to have a stroke from the\namount of MSG that's in this food.\n\nDELIA\nThis is our first meal in this\nhouse, Lydia.  Why don't we all do\nour little private parts to make\nit a pleasant one?\n\nCHARLES\nLydia, relax.  We'll build you a\ndarkroom in the basement.\n\nLYDIA\n(dramatically)\nMy whole life is a darkroom!\nOne... big... dark... room.\n\nDelia rolls her eyes and nods.  She's been through this\nbefore.\n\nDELIA\nNonsense... you'll go to school,\nmaybe meet a farm boy.\n\nDelia laughs.  Charles smiles.\n\nLYDIA\n(doleful)\nYeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll\nlet me hang myself from a rope in\nhis barn.\n\nCHARLES\nLydia, in a couple of years this\nwhole town will be filled with\npeople like us.\n\nDELIA\nWe'll be the art center of summer\nNew York.  I'll start sculpting\nagain... I'll teach those gallery\nbastards to refuse my sculpture.\nAnd when Otho and I get through\nwith this house, you people are\nnot going to recognize it.\n\nLYDIA\n(dramatically)\nI say let's keep it the way it is.\n\nDelia stares at Lydia.\n\nCHARLES\n(smiles)\nGood idea!\n\nDelia shifts her glare to Charles.\n\nLYDIA\nI do.  I really like it.  I\nmean, it's already sort of like\nsomebody's home, isn't it?  Their\ncouch is comfortable and doesn't\nstick to your legs.  It smells\nlike a real home, not a French\nwhorehouse.\n\nDELIA\nLydia, at your age, you are so\nyoung.\n(back to business)\nCharles, we need to call that\nawful Jane Butterfield tomorrow\nand get the key to the attic door.\nCan't you find a way to hold back\nsome of her commission?\n\nCHARLES\nWe're going to have a lot to do\ntomorrow...\nThe Goodwill truck is coming.\n\nDELIA\n... and whatever is up there in\nthat attic goes away with it.\n\nCHARLES\nShould have it fumigated, too.  I\nsaw a fly today.\n\nLydia looks at them with a mixture of sadness and\nanger.\n\n\nOUTSIDE THE DOOR - ON THE STAIRS\n\n-- listening, sit Barbara and Adam.  A tear rolls down\nher face.\n\n\nINT. ATTIC - DAY\n\nAdam and Barbara are lying down on the floor, peering\nout of one of the small windows overlooking the front\nyard of the house.  The handbook open in front of them.\n\n\nEXT. FRONT YARD - ADAM AND BARBARA'S POV - DAY\n\nThe entire front yard is alive with workmen and their\nvehicles.  Plumbers, electricians, cable TV men, etc.\nIn the road on front of the house are several cars of\nrubbernecking locals, astonished by all the activity.\nThe City has come to Town.  Moving men continue to move\nin the Deetz' modern, expensive and ugly furniture.\nThey collide with Goodwill men coming out with the\nMaitlands' lovely antiques and personal possessions.\n\n\nINT. ATTIC - DAY\n\nAdam and Barbara just look at one another as if to say\n\"We're next!\"  Adam leafs through the handbook furi-\nously.\n\nBARBARA\nLook in the index...\n\nADAM\nNot really...  what's this?\n\nAdam pulls from the book an ancient, yellowed,\ncrumbling handbill.  He carefully opens it.\n\nON handbill -- very primitive, crude, red printing.\n\nADAM (V.O.)\n(reading)\nHaving difficulty adjusting?\nIs death a problem and not a\nsolution?  Unhappy with eternity?\nTroubled by the living?  Call\nBetelgeuse, the bio-exorcist.\nThat's Betelgeuse,  Betel...\n\nThe remainder of the sheet is torn off.\n\nON Barbara -- fingering the torn edge.  Looking in the\nbook for the remainder.  No luck.\n\nBARBARA\nThat's it?  No number, or\ninstructions?\n\nADAM\nNothing.  The bio-exorcist?  I\ndon't get it...\n\n\nINT. KITCHEN\n\nCharles, away from the chaos outside is calmly steeping\na mug of herb tea.  His solitude is interrupted by a\n2500 lb. Vulcan range breaking through a too-small\nkitchen window.\n\nCHARLES\n(shouting through\nthe window)\nWhat the hell are you trying to do\nout there?\n\n\nDELIA - OUTSIDE\n\nis berating the inept crane operator and shrieks\nperiodically at some fine art movers who are struggling\nunder her horrid modern welded steel sculptures.\n\n\nLYDIA\n\nsnaps photos of the mayhem.  She stops to scan the whole\nhouse.\n\n\nLYDIA'S POV\n\nWhen her gaze reaches to top of the house, she suddenly\nglimpses Barbara and Adam's faces in the window.\n\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nLydia blinks hard.  Her mouth drops open.  She looks\nall around -- as if she'd just seen a ghost or two.\n\n\nJANE BUTTERFIELD'S CAR\n\npulls up.  Little Jane sits in the front seat, burdened\nwith an enormous stack of collated and stapled copies.\n\nLydia catches sight of Jane and runs over.\n\nLittle Jane locks her door, in fear of Lydia-the\nstrange.  Lydia stares at her.\n\nLITTLE JANE\nAre you a boy or a girl?\n\nLYDIA\nI only speak to vertebrates.\n\nLYDIA\nWhat happened to the people who\nused to live here?\n\nLITTLE JANE\n(ratty little voice)\nThey drowned!\n\nJANE\nYes, they were family.  I was\ndevastated.\n(beat)\nHere, darling.\n\nJane hands a key to Lydia.\n\nLYDIA\n(impressed)\nIs this the key to the attic?\n\nJANE\nThat's a skeleton key.  It'll open\nany door in that house.  Will you\ngive it to your father?\n(handing her a\nbusiness card)\nAnd you might mention that I\nsingle-handedly decorated the\nhouse.  In case he needs advice in\nthat area.  Come see me.\n\nJane goes away.\n\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nLydia's face sobers as she looks up at the now empty\nattic window.\n\nDELIA (O.S.)\nHelp!  Get off me!\n\nLydia drops the skeleton key into her pocket surrepti-\ntiously.  She follows Delia's SHRIEKING.\n\n\nEXT. HOUSE - DAY\n\nLydia rounds the corner to see Delia, pinned flat\nagainst the house by one of her horrid steel sculp-\ntures.  Two movers are struggling to free her.  Lydia\nsnaps a quick photograph.\n\nThey finally free Delia.  She clutches at her head,\njust short of tearing her hair out.\n\nDELIA\nYou jerks!  That is my art, and it\nis dangerous!  You think I want to\nwant to die like that?\n(seeing Lydia)\nLydia.  Moving is a family affair.\nSo buckle down now and go get\nMommy some drugs.\n\nLYDIA\nAny particular kind?\n\nDELIA\nJoke!  Joke!  Aspirin!\n\nLydia walks off toward the house.\n\n\nINT. ATTIC - DAY\n\nBarbara is half-hiding on the edge of the window.\n\nBARBARA\nThat little girl saw us.\n\nADAM\nShe couldn't have.  We can't make\nthem see us.\n\nBARBARA\nBut she saw us.  I could feel it.\n\nADAM\n(pause, thinking\nthat over)\nThat's all we need.\n\n\nINT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY\n\nLydia looks up the stairs at the attic landing.  She's\na little scared.  She decides to go up the dark stairs.\n\nIN THE HALL\n\nAt the end of the hall stands Charles, directing men\nwho are carrying books into the room that will be his\nstudy.\n\nHe continues on.\n\n\nA BLAST of STEAM\n\nfills the hallway, because workmen are already going at\nthe wallpaper.  Lydia emerges from it.  Looking up at\nstairway to attic, mounting courage.\n\n\nINT. STAIRCASE TO ATTIC - DAY\n\nLydia creeps upward, taking the skeleton key from her\npocket.  FLOORBOARDS SQUEAK.\n\n\nINT. ATTIC - DAY\n\nAdam works on his model.  He hears the SQUEAK, looks up\nconfidently.\n\nADAM\n(whispering)\nDon't worry.  I've locked it.\n\nBarbara smiles and knits while rocking in her chair.\n\n\nINT. ATTIC LANDING\n\nLydia quietly inserts the key in the lock of the attic\ndoor.  She turns it.  The key is stiff.  She turns\nharder.  It's stuck.  Lydia tries the door -- it's no\ngo.  She turns the key again.  This time it goes all\nthe way around.\n\n\nINT. ATTIC - DAY\n\nBarbara and Adam, surprised by the key, look at each\nother, carefully, very quietly, stand up and tiptoe\ntoward door.\n\n\nON THE SCREEN OF AN OLD TV SET\n\nin the corner of the attic -- Suddenly -- a ghostly\nimage POPS ON.\n\n\nON TV - A BIZARRE, SMALLISH FELLOW\n\noutfitted in a too-big cowboy hat, bad wig, and over-\nsized sunglasses appears on screen singing very\nquickly.  (It's a heavily disguised BETELGEUSE.)\n\n\nBEHIND HIM\n\nthe CAMERA QUICKLY PANS an assortment of tombstones a\nla Cal Worthington.\n\nBETELGEUSE\n(singing)\nHave the living got you down?\nBetelgeuse!\nAre they jacking you around?\nBetelgeuse!\nHave you broken out in hives\n'Cause you're tired of their jive?\nI will drive them from your\nhive... Betelgeuse!\n\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nCAMERA TILTS DOWN a flashing tombstone with\n\"BETELGEUSE\" written on it.  Adam rushes over to shut\nit off.  He can't find a plug.  He looks around behind\nset... no workings inside at all.  He peers around to\nthe screen.  It is blank.  Suddenly -- Betelgeuse POPS\nON AGAIN.\n\nBETELGEUSE\nSay it once... Betelgeuse\nSay it twice... Betelgeuse.\nThe third time's a charm...\nBetelgeuse!\nCome on down!\n\nHe POPS OFF.  Adam and Barbara stare at each other.\n\n\nINT. LANDING - DAY\n\nLydia listens.  Did she hear something?  She puts her\nhand on the knob and tries to turn it.  It's stuck.\n\nThen the key eerily pops out of the lock and falls on\nthe floor.\n\nCharles' head suddenly appears behind her.  Scares her.\n\nCHARLES\nWhat are you doing?\n\n\nINT. ATTIC\n\nAdam is holding on tight to the knob of the door.  With\nher knitting needle, Barbara has poked the key out.\n\nThe two stand absolutely still, listening, terrified of\nthe living intruders.\n\n\nINT. ATTIC LANDING - LYDIA AND CHARLES\n\nLYDIA\nI was just trying to open the\ndoor.  Mrs. Butterfield brought\nover a skeleton key.\n\nCHARLES\nLet me have it.\n\n\nINT. ATTIC - DAY\n\nBarbara and Adam tighten.\n\n\nON THE LANDING\n\nLYDIA\nBut it doesn't work.\n\nShe hands her father the key.  He looks at it and\nthrows it in the corner.\n\nCHARLES\nSkeleton keys never work.  Anyway,\nthis can wait.  We'll get a\ncrowbar later.  Where's your\nmother?\n\nLYDIA\n(very quick de-\ncisive delivery)\nStepmother.\n\nCHARLES\nI'm going down to relax.  I want a\nnoise-free zone.  Do you\nunderstand?  Noise-free.\n\nHe goes down the stairs.\n\nLYDIA\nDad?\n\nHe continues.\n\nCHARLES\n(irritated, over\nhis shoulder)\nWhat?\n\nLYDIA\nI'm lonely.\n\nA BLAST OF STEAM from below drowns out her words.\nCharles stops and turns around.  The BLAST STOPS.\n\nCHARLES\nWhat?\n\n\nTIGHT ON LYDIA\n\nShe is resolved.\n\nLYDIA\nNothing.\n\nCharles continues.  She begins to follow slowly.\n\n\nON KEY\n\nbehind Lydia.  WIDEN as Adam rushes out the door, grabs\nthe key and rushes back in again.  Lydia hears some-\nthing but doesn't see.\n\n\nINT. ATTIC\n\nBarbara and Adam have moved away from the door.\n\nADAM\n(looking through\nthe handbook)\nWe need some help.  I found\nsomething this morning.  Here.\nEmergencies.\n(reads)\n\"In case of emergency, draw door.\"\n\nBARBARA\nDraw door?  I don't know why we\nkeep looking in that stupid book.\n\nAdam takes a piece of chalk and draws a little door on\nthe exposed brick of the chimney.\n\nBARBARA\n(continuing)\nYou don't actually think this\nis going to work?\n\nAdam draws a doorknob.  Then he tries to turn it.  The\ndoor, perhaps to his surprise, fails to open.\n\nBARBARA\nYet another triumph for Adam and\nBarbara in the afterlife.  Why\ndon't we try this Beetle guy??...\n\nADAM\nWait.\n\nHe looks at book, then writes on the door:  KNOCK AND\nENTER.  He exchanges a glance with Barbara.  She's even\nmore skeptical than before.  Turns away in disgust.\n\nAdam knocks on the door, and turns the knob.  Nothing.\nShe is more disgusted.  Adam goes back to the book.\n\nADAM\n(continuing)\nAha!  Knock three times.\n\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nHe knocks three times.  Turns knob.  The chalked door\nswings magnificently open.\n\nBehind is an eerie light source, SOARING MUSIC, maybe\neven a heavenly choir singing pear-shaped syllables.\n\nBarbara and Adam look at one another again.  They hold\nhands and step tentatively through.\n\nTheir figures are lost in the blinding light.\n\nThey start to shut door after them.\n\n\nON THE ATTIC LANDING\n\nLydia is staring at the light pouring from under the\nattic door.  It suddenly goes out.\n\nON LYDIA\n\nShe is dumbfounded.  She listens.\n\n\nON THE LANDING\n\nLydia speeds down the steps.\n\n\nINT. CHARLES' STUDY - DAY\n\nCharles, fiercely intent on relaxing, paces like a\ncatfish out of water.  Ralph Lauren in K-mart.  He\nstretches.  He sits uneasily in an easy chair, tries\nlike hell to get comfortable.  Finally, he puts a book\nunder his bottom to get sitting straight.  Looks around\ntapping his fingers.  What to do?  Looks at watch.\n\nHe takes down a book from Adam's library, it is an\nAudubon book of birds.  He whips through it like it's\nthe comics and then looks around for more.\n\nHe finds the \"Illustrated Walden\" by Thoreau.  He\nspeed reads it.\n\nHe is now really bored.  Goes to the fireplace, tries\nto light it.  Cannot do it.  Goes to desk and writes:\n\nOTHO-INSTALL GAS FIRE LOGS IN\nSTUDY.\n\nHe studies bird posters.  Finds beautiful cardinal\npicture.\n\nTakes field glasses and looks out window.\n\n\nHIS POV\n\nSpies big ugly-looking ratty bird devouring something.\n\n\nON CHARLES\n\nhorrified.  Wrinkles his nose.\n\nLydia enters.  He jumps.\n\nCHARLES\nJesus Christ!\n\nLydia is shocked.\n\nCHARLES\n(continuing)\nDarling, can't you see I'm\nrelaxing in here!\n\nLYDIA\nWell I just wanted to tell you\nwhat I saw.\n\nCHARLES\nLydia.  What the hell is the point\nof my moving up here if you people\nwon't let me relax?  Go help your\nmother.\n\nCharles returns to field glasses, spies something.  She\nlooks at him in frustration.\n\nLYDIA\n(on her way out)\nFine.  Maybe you can relax in a\nhaunted house.  But I can't.\n\nShe exits.  Charles peers after her, brow furrowed.\nLooks out again at the village.  Uses his field glasses\nto get a better look.\n\n\nHIS POV\n\nIt is the Bozman Building.  Ernie is out front pol-\nishing the brass lion.\n\n\nON CHARLES\n\nHe thinks.  Moves the field glasses to punctuate his\ndiscovery of the building.  (His eyes never leave field\nglasses throughout the following.)\n\nCHARLES\nNice building... Bad paint.  Good\nlines... bad roof.  Good\nparking... hmmm???\n\nThat really registers with him.  Without looking, he\ndials a familiar number on the phone with one hand,\nlifts the receiver.  He clacks his teeth together pur-\nposefully.\n\nSECRETARY'S VOICE\nBotco International.\n\nCHARLES\nYes, I'd like to speak with Maxie\nDean.\n\nSECRETARY'S VOICE\nHe's not in right now.\n\nCHARLES\nWell tell him that Charles Deetz\ncalled.\n\nHe hangs up and continues to spy on Bozman Building.\nClacks his teeth.\n\nCHARLES\n(continuing)\nMy God what I could do with that\nparking.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n\nTIGHT SHOT - BARBARA AND ADAM\n\nVery still, they look cautiously to the right and left\n-- just with their eyes.  They're astounded by what\nthey see, though we don't yet see it.\n\nADAM\n... Not what I expected when we\nwalked through that door.\n\nBARBARA\nNo. But it's somewhere without big\nworms.\n\nCAMERA DRAWS BACK and we find that Adam and Barbara are\nin:\n\n\nINT. WAITING ROOM - DAY\n\nThe most unpleasant waiting room that you ever remember\nwaiting in.  Fifties furniture with broken legs,\ncouches propped up on telephone books.\n\nStanding ashtrays with dirty stand.  Linoleum floors\npatched a hundred times.  National Geographics with the\ncovers torn off.  The \"Take a number\" registers in the\nmillions.\n\n\nAS THE CAMERA COMPLETES A CIRCLE OF THE ROOM\n\nWe see a RECEPTIONIST.  She's the quintessential 50's\nreceptionist -- tight sweater, bullet-breasted bra,\nbleached hair, red lipstick.  She's wearing a ribbon\nacross her breast reading \"MISS ARGENTINA\" and there\nare knife slashes across both wrists.\n\nRECEPTIONIST\nYou don't have an appointment, do\nyou?\n\nADAM\nW... We didn't know how to make one.\n\nBARBARA\nAn appointment for what?\n\nRECEPTIONIST\nWhat do you want?\n\nBARBARA\nWe need some help.\n\nRECEPTIONIST\nAlready?  You just bit the big one\nnine months ago and you want help?\n\nADAM\nNine months?  What difference does\nthat make?\n\nRECEPTIONIST\n(shrugging)\nGood luck.  You're going to use up\nall your help vouchers.\n\nADAM\nHelp vouchers?\n\nRECEPTIONIST\nD-90's.  You spend a hundred\nand twenty-five years on earth,\nactually, in that house, during\nwhich you get only three class-one\nD-90 intercessions with Juno.  You\nprobably haven't even read through\nthe manual completely yet.\n\nBARBARA\nWhy three?\n\n\nTYPIST\n\nBehind the Receptionist holds up both hands each of\nwhich have only three fingers on them.\n\nTYPIST\nRule Number Three.  Everything\ncomes in threes...\n\nRECEPTIONIST\nYou'll have to wait if you don't\nhave an appointment.\n\nBARBARA\nHow long do we have to wait?\n\nADAM\nWait for who?\n\nRECEPTIONIST\nFor Juno, your caseworker.  Not\nthat it matters to your type.  But\nthere are all these other people\nhere ahead of you.  I'd say 3\nhours.\n\nThe waiting room is now filled with people.  Dead\npeople, some in fairly awful states.  A cornucopia of\ncarnal shreddage.\n\nAdam and Barbara look around for a moment, then very\nquietly, they reach out to grasp hands.\n\nRECEPTIONIST\n(continuing)\nNumber 54 million, six hundred\none.  Ferndock.\n\nCAMERA PUSHES IN CLOSE.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n\nINT. ATTIC LANDING - DAY\n\nLydia kneels down with a screwdriver, a nail file, an\nice pick, and a credit card.  She inserts nail file\ninto the door.  She struggles, and after several\nattempts -- finally uses the ice pick and POP!  The\ndoor swings open ominously.\n\n\nINT. ATTIC - DAY\n\nLydia enters.  The room is dim, and filled with dust\nmotes.  There are shadows in all the corners.\n\nShe bumps into a switch which engages the model sun and\nmoon and that eerily illuminates the model town.  She's\nfrightened, then entranced.\n\nShe peers at it from different angles, her fear for-\ngotten.  She notes small tools scattered around an\nunfinished area.  She continues around the model,\noblivious to everything else.  Then...\n\nShe kicks something.  Ducks under the table and comes\nup with something, holds it up to the light.  It's the\nhandbook.  She looks through it.  Finds the marked\npage... looks at the chalk door.\n\n\nINT. OFFICE - DAY\n\nBarbara and Adam are still holding hands, as if they\nhadn't moved.  Like waiting for an IRS audit.\n\nBARBARA\n(to Adam)\nIs this what happens when you die?\n\nThe Receptionist overhears.  She points at Barbara.\n\nRECEPTIONIST\nThis is what happens when YOU die.\n(points to another\ncorpse)\nThat is what happens when HE dies.\nThat is what happens when THEY\ndie.  It's highly personal.  And\nI'll tell you something... if I\nknew then what I know now... I\nwouldn't have had my little\n\"accident!\"\n\nShe holds up her wrists and smiling at her little joke,\nwriggles them indicating her slashes.\n\nOTHER CORPSES\n(all together)\nAmen!\n\nBarbara and Adam look at them.  Corpses resume doing\nwhat they were doing.  A GRINDING NOISE O.S. -- The\nReceptionist looks up.\n\nBarbara and Adam also look O.S.\n\n\nTHEIR POV\n\nA Message delivery wire GRINDS along loudly on a\npulley.  The actual message is held in the hand of the\nMESSENGER, a flattened corpse, suspended as if on a\nshirt clothesline, tire marks on his face and clothing.\nA major roadkill.  Dust and gravel ground into him.  He\nsmiles wanly at Barbara and Adam as the Receptionist\ntakes a message on a piece of paper and reads it.\n\nRECEPTIONIST\nMaitland, party of two!  Take your\nhandbook and go to the sixth door.\n\nBarbara and Adam upset at the loss of their handbook...\n\nBARBARA\nWe forgot our handbook.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n\nINT. ATTIC - DAY\n\nLydia is studying the handbook with intense interest.\n\nCHARLES (O.S.)\n(from distant\ndownstairs)\nLydia, Delia needs your help!\n\nLydia gives one more look at the book, and then goes to\nthe door quickly and silently.\n\nCHARLES (O.S.)\nRight now, Delia says!\n\n\nINT. OFFICE - DAY\n\nRECEPTIONIST\n(shaking her head\nin disgust)\nOut that way, through the typing\npool, down the corridor, sixth\ndoor on your left.  Sixth door.\nTwo threes.\n(shaking her head)\nAirhead.\n\nAdam and Barbara walk through a door.\n\n\nINT. TYPING POOL - DAY\n\nA vast room of desks arranged in a grid, straight\nout of \"How To Succeed In Business\"... Each desk is\noccupied, too, but most of the secretaries are merely\nskeletons, or mouldering corpses slumped over their\ntypewriters.\n\nOnly one secretary, somewhere in the vast grid, is\ntyping slowly, with long pauses between words.\n\nThe Messenger on his return trip, parallels Barbara and\nAdam as they walk along.  Barbara can't look at him.\n\nMESSENGER\nHow do I look?  There're no\nmirrors on this side.\n\nADAM\n(trying to be\npleasant)\nFine, you look fine.\n\nMESSENGER\nThanks.  I've been feeling a\nlittle flat.\n\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nHe laughs at his own joke as he goes back through the\nvery, very narrow slot in the wall where the line\nruns.  Adam and Barbara look to the right and left.\nA vast stack of files slips off a desk and spills out\nonto the floor.\n\n\nINT. CORRIDOR - DAY\n\nBarbara and Adam enter corridor.\n\nEmpty, like a hotel corridor, but all the doors are of\ndifferent types -- a revolving door, a dutch door,\nchurch doors.  They walk past a waist-high window,\ncovered by a roll-up shade.\n\nBARBARA\nA hundred twenty-five years!\nI can't believe it.  I can't\nbelieve they didn't tell us.\n\nShe bumps into the shade and it rolls up FLAPPING.  She\nstares in through the window.  Adam peers in it too.\n\n\nTHEIR POV\n\nA smouldering, mist-filled room.  From the smoky plasma\nfloats an occasional tortured soul.  Unspeakably SAD\nMUSIC wafts from within.  They get only a glimpse of\nthe bodies in this horrible human soup.\n\nBARBARA\nAdam, look at this.\n\nSuddenly, floating up from below, immediately on the\nother side of the window, a white-crepe face emerges.\nIt seems to be that of a woman, her eyes are red and\nblue tears rim them.  Her pale skin is covered with a\nflaking crust of salt.  She wears the saddest look\never.  Her mouth opens plaintively but no sound comes.\n\nBARBARA\n(continuing)\nOh, Adam... what is this?\n\nA reflection joins them on their side of the window.\n\n\nA SINISTER LITTLE JANITOR\n\nwizened and efficient, pulls the shade down firmly.\n\nSINISTER MAN\nThat's the lost souls room.\nA room for ghosts who have been\nexorcised.  Poor devils.  That's\ndeath for the dead.  It's all in\nthe handbook.  Keep moving.\n\nThe man scuttles off.  Adam and Barbara walk on sadly,\nuntil they come to a door that looks exactly like the\nswinging door between the kitchen and dining room of\ntheir house.\n\nADAM\nThis is it... the sixth door.\n\nPuzzled -- Barbara pushes it.\n\n\nINT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nEverything is dark, quiet -- but the furniture is\nobviously not theirs, and neither is the decoration.\nAdam and Barbara exchange glances, and push on through\ninto the living room.\n\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nQuiet, dark.  Everyone's asleep.\n\nADAM\nMy God, we're back home.\n\nBARBARA\nLook at this, everything is\ndifferent down here.  All our\nfurniture is gone.\n\nADAM\nHow long do you suppose we were\nwaiting?\n\nJUNO\nThree months.\n\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nA spot comes on, revealing JUNO -- their caseworker.\nShe's an older woman, no nonsense about her.  Over-\ndressed in an outfit that includes a blouse with\nruffled cuffs.  We will at some point catch a glimpse\nof her slashed throat -- she smokes heavily.  Occa-\nsionaly smoke puffs from her cut throat.\n\nJUNO\nI'd nearly given up on you.  I was\nabout to leave.  I do have other\nclients.\n\nBARBARA\nAre you Juno, our caseworker?\n\nJUNO\nYes.  I evaluate individual cases\nand determine if help is needed,\ndeserved, and available.\n\nBARBARA\nWe need help.  We deserve help.\n\nADAM\nAre you available?\n\nJUNO\nNo.\n(beat)\nWhat's wrong?\n\nBARBARA\nWe're very unhappy.\n\nJUNO\nWhat do you expect?  You're dead.\n\nADAM\nWe'd like some help in getting rid\nof the people who moved in here.\nBarbara and I worked very hard on\nthis house.\n\nBARBARA\nWe probably wouldn't mind sharing\nthe house with people who were --\n\nJUNO\n-- like you used to be?\n\nBARBARA\nYes.\n\nADAM\nBut these people --\n\nHe indicates a particularly bad piece of Delia's sculp-\nture.  Juno walks around it shaking her head.\n\n\nINT. HOUSE\n\nThe following conversation takes place as Barbara and\nAdam follow Juno as she looks around the house and ends\nup in their attic space.\n\nJUNO\nThings seem pretty quiet here.\nYou should thank God you didn't\ndie in Italy.\n(checking the file)\nThe Deetzes.  Okay.  Have you been\nstudying the manual?\n\nADAM\nWe tried.\n\nJUNO\nThe Intermediate Interface chapter\non Haunting says it all.  Get 'em\nout yourself.  It's your house.\nHaunted houses don't come easy.\n\nBARBARA\nWe don't quite get it.\n\nJuno's watch BUZZES, she stops it.\n\nJUNO\nI heard.\n(refers to her file)\nTore your face right off!  Bad\nnews.  It obviously doesn't do\nany good to pull your heads off in\nfront of people if they can't see\nyou.\n\nADAM\nWe have to start simpler, is that\nit?\n\nJUNO\nStart simply.  Do what you know.\nUse your talents.  Practice.  We\nonly help those who help\nthemselves.  Just do a little at a\ntime.  And of course, practice,\npractice, practice.  It's tricky\nbut -- you weren't murderers by\nany chance, were you?\n\nBARBARA\nNo.\n\nJUNO\nPity.  Murderers seem to have an\neasy time of it.  Just look at\nAmityville.\n(reminiscing)\nHe was one of my boys.  Didn't\nhave to give that one any lessons.\nFrom day one... But I must be\noff... I've got a plane load of\nfootball players crashed in the\nmidwest... they need a lot of\nhelp, just with the basics.\n\nPoints at her head indicating dumbness.\n\nBARBARA\nIf... we have trouble.  What about\nthe guy in the flyer?  Betelge...\n\nJUNO\n(quickly interrupt-\ning her)\nDon't say his name, you don't want\nhis help.\n\nAdam and Barbara look at each other.  Puzzled.\n\nADAM & BARBARA\nWell... We might...\n\n\nINT. ATTIC - NIGHT\n\nJuno peers into the model cemetery with interest.  A\nFLY BUZZES around her.  Juno blows it away.  Fly flees.\n\nJUNO\nNo you don't!  He does not work\nwell with others.\n\nBARBARA\nWhat do you mean?  What's he do?\n\nA grave look comes over Juno's face as the light\nchanges to suggest someone telling a ghost story around\na campfire.\n\nJUNO\nI wasn't going to bring it up --\nbut rather than have you stumble\ninto it and make another mistake,\nI'll tell you --\n(she nervously puffs\nher cigarette)\nHe was my assistant, but he was a\ntroublemaker...\nHe went out on his own as a free-\nlance bio-exorcist -- claims to\nget rid of the living... got into\nmore trouble -- you remember the\nChicago Fire...\n\nAdam and Barbara look at each other.  Juno continues.\n\nJUNO\n(continuing)\nHe was demoted to a Grade-6\nmalevolent spirit.  He's been\nimprisoned on that plane ever\nsince... in fact, I believe he's\nbeen sleezing around your cemetery\nlately.  He can only be brought\nback by saying his name three\ntimes.\n\nAdam and Barbara attempt to interrupt --\n\nJUNO\n(continuing)\nBut I strongly suggest that you\nremove the Deetz's yourself.\n\nShe takes a final drag on the cigarette and smoke\nbillows out the hole in her throat.  Juno starts to\nFADE.\n\nADAM\nAnd if we need you again, how do\nwe...?\n\nJuno fades.  Gone.  Barbara goes to the model, looks\nat the cemetery.\n\nBARBARA\nThat guy is in our cemetery.  Oh,\nAdam.\n\nADAM\n(holds her shoul-\nders, calms her)\nLook, she's right.  We'll just\nstart simple, honey, be tougher.\nI feel... confident.  C'mon.\n\nThey exit.\n\n\nCAMERA FOLLOWS ACTION - OVER THE MODEL\n\nThe FLY BUZZES.  It lands and crawls along into the model of\nthe cemetery.\n\n\nTHE FLY\n\nresplendently green and iridescent, pauses and fiddles\nwith its hairy parts.  Starts to walk by.\n\nVOICE\nPssstt!  Over here!\n\nFly stops.  Tilts its multi-eyed head.\n\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nTwo hands come up from the earth of that grave holding\na candy bar.\n\nVOICE\nI can't use this.  You should have\nit.  Flies get so little respect\nanymore.\n\n\nTHE FLATTERED FLY\n\nwalks over to the grave.  In a flash, the hands grab\nthe struggling fly and dance it like a doll over the\ngrave and then pull it into the earth.\n\nFLY\nBuzzz!\n(turns into)\nHelp me!  Help me!\n\nA MANIACAL LAUGH grows from the grave.  WIND BLOWS as\nthe Fly disappears.  Ivy whips away from the grave-\nstone.  We see, for the first time, the chiseled name:\n\nBETELGEUSE\n\nCLAP OF THUNDER.\n\n\nINT. CHARLES' STUDY - NIGHT\n\nCharles is on the phone.  He has drawings laid out in\nfront of him.  He is at his most urban persuasive, and\noddly relaxed -- he is finally in his own element.\n\nCHARLES\nMaxie, have I not always made you\nmoney?  I think that is the only\nreal question here.\n\n\nINT. MAXIE'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nNew York office, cool design, black couch, and MAXIE\nDEAN, a 55-year-old, super tan, white-haired wheeler\ndealer.  Sign says:  CHAIRMAN of BOTCO INDUSTRIES.\nMaxie looks rich and he looks cool as he talks to\nCharles.  Behind him, Sarah, his rich-looking blonde\nwife, is looking at herself in a mirror.\n\nMAXIE\nWell, Charles -- no one has made me\nmoney like you.  Until your nerves\nwent, you were a demon.  It is\njust that... Winter River,\nConnecticut is, you'll forgive me,\nno fucking where.  Why would I\ninvest that kind of money to buy\nan old building way the hell up\nthere?\n\n\nINTERCUT CONVERSATION\n\nCHARLES\nNot a building!  That's the beauty\nof it.  I think I can buy the\nwhole town.  These people don't\nknow the value of their property!\n\nMAXIE\nThen we own a whole town full of\nnowhere.\n\nCHARLES\nNo, No -- C'mon, Max, you know\nme.  I've got plans.  You gotta\ncome up here and see, then I'll\ntell you about it.\n\nMaxie isn't much interested.\n\nMAXIE\nWell, sure, Charles, but I am busy\nhere... you know how it was when\nyou were active.\n\nThis burns Charles.  But he swallows it.  He hears\nsomething in the corridor outside -- a kind of LOW\nMOANING.\n\nCHARLES\n(into telephone)\nJust a minute, Maxie.  Somebody.\n\nMAXIE\nNo listen... we'll talk about\nthis visiting later, I gotta go,\nI gotta meeting on the Japanese\njoint venture.\n\nCHARLES\n(torn between the\nMOANING and Maxie)\nGreat idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese\ncould run it for us.  Listen,\nthink right about it, will you?\nWe've almost got the house ready,\nyou bring Sarah with you and I'll\nshow you.\n\nMAXIE\nYeah yeah, we'll think on it.\nBye ya, Charles.  You relax up\nthere, ya hear?\n\nMaxie hangs up.  Shakes his head.\n\nMAXIE\n(continuing)\nPutz!  Inter River?  My ass.\n\n\nINT. CHARLES' STUDY - NIGHT\n\nCharles hangs up frustrated.  MOANING INCREASES.  He\ngoes to the door and flings it open.\n\nA figure is right there in the doorway -- A ghost under\na sheet.  But a \"designer\" sheet.  He wails away like a\nbanshee.  Eyeholes cut in sheets, Charles jumps, re-\ncovers.\n\nCHARLES\nOh, Jesus, Lydia!  Is Connecticut\nso boring that you have to think\nup shit like this?\n\nON Barbara, she stands back away from the door observ-\ning skeptically.\n\nCHARLES\n(continuing)\nI had Maxie Dean on the phone!\nDarling, Dad's found a way to make\nsome money here while I relax, so\nscram!\n\nHe slams the door, turns around.  Then turns around\nagain, and jerks the door open.  The ghost is retreat-\ning, beaten.\n\nCHARLES\n(continuing)\nAnd your mother is going to kill\nyou when she sees that you cut\nholes in her $300 sheets.  You\nprovoke her you know.  I mean she\ncan be an unreasonable bitch.  But\nyou do provoke her.\n\nHe SLAMS the door again.\n\n\nINT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\nAdam helps Barbara on with her sheet.\n\nBARBARA\nGod, this is so corny.  Have we\nbeen reduced to this?  Sheets?\n\nADAM\nThink of them as death shrouds.\nAnd the moaning is important.\nReally moan!\n(imitating Juno)\nPractice, practice, practice.\n\n\nINT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nTelevision still going, Delia asleep with curlers.\nAdam and Barbara glide inside, go over and stand beside\nthe bed.\n\nADAM\nDeep breath... and...\n\n\nINT. LYDIA'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\nShe has her ever-present camera around her neck.  Sud-\ndenly hears MOANS from her parents' room.  Thinking it\nis sexual, she cringes.  Covers her ears.\n\nLYDIA\nGross!  How can he stand that\nwoman?\n(louder)\nHey, cut it out!  I'm a child!\nFor God sakes!\n\nThe NOISE gets weirder.  Lydia gets interested.\n\n\nINT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nAdam and Barbara moan and groan.  Delia doesn't stir.\n\nBARBARA\nI feel really stupid.\n\nADAM\nIt's not stupid.  We're ghosts.\nDo you want this woman for\nbreakfast for 125 years?  Moan\nlouder!\n\nBarbara moans louder and more weirdly.\n\nDelia stirs, sits up, but doesn't open her eyes.\n\nAdam and Barbara are excited then... disappointed as\nDelia fumbles on the bedside table for the remote con-\ntrol device, and without opening her eyes, turns off\nthe television set.  Then she turns over, and is lost\nto the world totally.\n\nBarbara sighs.  She and Adam walk toward the door.\nWhen they open it however, Lydia is standing there in\nher pajamas -- she snaps a FLASH Polaroid -- and Adam\nand Barbara jump backwards with yelps of fright.\n\nLYDIA\nSick!  Sexual perversion!  If\nyou're going to do weird sexual\nstuff you ought to stay in your\nbedroom, okay?\n\nLydia starts back into her room.  Then looks at the\ndeveloping photograph.  Something catches her eye.\n\nLydia yelps with fear.\n\nLYDIA\nHoly cow!  No feet!\n\nShe screams.  Adam and Barbara scream.  Lydia rushes\nback toward them, starts flashing pictures.\n\nAdam and Barbara run around and are pushed into a\ncorner.  Polaroids fly everywhere.\n\nLydia runs out of film.  She stares at them, panting\nwith fear.  A standoff.\n\nLYDIA\n(continuing)\nA... Are you the guys who're\nhiding out in the attic?\n\nADAM\n(fake terror voice)\nWe're ghosts.\n\nBarbara moans.\n\nLYDIA\n(skeptical, cautious)\nW... What do you look like under\nthere?\n\nAdam and Barbara pull shut bedroom door, go out into\nthe hall -- as if to keep from waking Delia with their\nconversation.\n\n\nINT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\nAll three stare at each other tentatively.\n\nADAM\nAren't you scared?\n\nLYDIA\nI'm not scared of Ralph Lauren.\nThose are sheets.  Are you gross\nunder there?  Are you \"Night of\nthe Living Dead\" under there?\nLike all bloody veins and pus?\n\nADAM\nWhat?\n\nLYDIA\n\"Night of the Living Dead?\"  It's\na movie.\n\nBARBARA\n(pulling off\nthe sheet)\nIf I had seen a ghost at your age,\nI would have been frightened out\nof my wits.\n\nLYDIA\nYou're not gross.  Why were you\nwearing a sheet?\n\nBARBARA\nWe're practicing.\n\nADAM\nYou can actually see us?  Without\nthe sheets?\n\nLYDIA\nIs this like a trick question?\n\nBARBARA\nTell the truth.\n\nLYDIA\n(offended)\nOf course I can see you.\n\nADAM\nNobody else can.\n\nLYDIA\nI'm wearing contacts... Also I\nread through the \"Handbook for the\nRecently Deceased.\"  It says that\nlive people ignore the strange and\nunusual... I, myself, am strange\nand unusual.\n\nBARBARA\n(tenderly)\nYou look like a regular girl to me.\n\nLydia blushes.  Barbara smiles warmly.  She is begin-\nning to like Lydia.\n\nADAM\nYou read our book?  Could you\nfollow it?\n\nLydia nods her head.\n\nLYDIA\nWhy are you creeping around\nDelia's bedroom?\n\nADAM\nWe were trying to scare your\nmother.\n\nLYDIA\nStepmother.  I'm very sensitive\nabout being related to reptiles.\n\nBarbara smiles.\n\nLYDIA\n(continuing)\nYou can't scare her.  She's\nsleeping with Prince Valium\ntonight.\n(defiantly)\nI stole the key to your attic, you\nknow.\n\nAdam and Barbara look at each other.\n\nBARBARA\nMaybe we better talk.\n\n\nINT. ATTIC ROOM - NIGHT\n\nAdam's rigged up the moon, and stars, too.  Adam and\nBarbara and Lydia stand just beyond the fringes of the\ntown, dimly lighted giants.\n\nLYDIA\nYou did this?  You carved all\nthese little figures and houses\nand things?\n\nADAM\n(pleased)\nI certainly did.  I'd finish it\ntoo, but... I don't get out much.\n\nLYDIA\nAnd this used to be your house, I\nbet.  Why do you want to scare\neverybody?\n\nADAM\nWe want to frighten you away.\n(a little embarrassed)\nSo that you'll move out.\n\nLYDIA\nYou don't know the Deetz's very\nwell, do you?  My father bought\nthis place.  He never walks away\nfrom equity.  Why don't you leave?\n\nBARBARA\nWe can't.  We haven't left the\nhouse since the funeral.\n\nLYDIA\nFuneral.  God, you guys really are\ndead!\n(fascinated)\nWhat was it like?  The funeral.\nDid you cry?\n\nADAM\nWe weren't there.  The handbook\nsays funerals aren't for the dead.\n\nLYDIA\nGod, if this is true this is\namazing!  I kinda like it up\nhere.  Can I visit you sometimes?\n\nADAM\nWell, I don't know... We don't get\nmany visitors.\n\nBARBARA\nYou know you're really a pretty\ngirl.\n\nLydia flushes.\n\nCHARLES (O.S.)\nLydia!\n\nLYDIA\nI better go...\n\nBARBARA\nWait... I don't think it would be\na very good idea if you told your\nparents that we're up here.\n\nADAM\nUnless you think it would scare\nthem off.\n\nLydia starts to exit.\n\nADAM\n(continuing)\nYou tell them that we are\ndesperate horrible ghoulish\ncreatures who will stop at nothing\nto get back our house.\n\nLYDIA\n(looks him up\nand down)\nWait a minute, what if this is a\ndream?  Can you do any tricks to\nprove I'm not dreaming?\n\nBarbara shakes her head, a little ashamed.\n\nLYDIA\n(continuing)\nWell, if you are real ghosts, you\nbetter get another routine, those\nsheets suck!\n\nShe sneaks a smile at Barbara and exits.\n\n\nEXT. HOUSE - DAY\n\nA big ugly machine is doing something unnecessary to\nthe yard.\n\n\nINT. DARKROOM/BASEMENT - DAY\n\nThe FAST-TICKING CLOCK is a timer.  Lydia is making\nPolaroid enlargements.  She's quick and expert at this.\nShe's examining a print with a magnifying glass.\n\n\nINT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - DAY\n\nDelia shrieks.  Going through the dirty clothes, she's\njust come across the sheets with the eye holes in them.\n\nDELIA\nLydia!  Lydia!  My hands are\nshredded from doing the laundry,\nand now I have to deal with your\nvandalism!\n\n\nINT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY\n\nLydia, pounding up from the basement with the wet\nprint, collides with Delia, rushing down from the sec-\nond floor with the scissored sheets.\n\nDELIA\nLydia, honest to God I'm going to\nkill you.  I'm having a party\ntonight.  I'm cooking, I can't get\nservants.  Do I need angst?  No, I\ncertainly do not!\n\nLydia speeds by her.\n\nDELIA\n(continuing)\nYou owe me three-hundred bucks,\nLydia!  Don't go running to your\nfather, you worm.\n\n\nINT. CHARLES' OFFICE - DAY\n\nLydia rushes in.  Charles is working furiously on a\nword processor, amidst an array of maps and plans.\n\nLYDIA\nDad.  Do you believe me?\n\nCHARLES\nYes.  Except when you creep around\nin your mother's --\n\nLYDIA\nStepmother's...\n\nCHARLES\n... sheets.\n\nLYDIA\nWell this is... I mean, this is\nthe weirdest --\n\nCHARLES\nLydia, I don't know what it is\nwith you and these pratical\njokes, but --\n\nLYDIA\nThis is not a joke!  That sheet\nwas full of ghosts.\n\nShe hands him the photo.  He looks.  Lydia points\nout...\n\nLYDIA\n(continuing)\nNo feet.\n\nCharles laughs.\n\nLYDIA\n(continuing)\nYou don't believe me.  That sheet\nwas full of ghosts.  They live\nhere.\n\nCharles begins to scroll through computer program.\n\nCHARLES\n(dismissing it)\nVery clever, Lydia.  Now would you\nplease -- I'll tell you what... I\nknow!  You're bored, right?  You\ntake that camera and your bike\nand photograph every building in\ntown.  Don't tell anyone what it's\nfor...\n(handing her a\nwad of bills)\nHere, take some cash and go do\nit.  How's that?  You want to\nstretch, don't you?\n\nLydia exits, with determination.  Charles looks up on\nthe wall and runs his finger over a plat map of Winter\nRiver, just like Adam's in the attic.\n\nCHARLES\n(continuing)\nLook at the size of these lots...\n\nAdam peers at the map, puzzled.\n\nADAM\nWhat is this guy doing?\n\nBarbara follows Lydia out.  Adam thinks, intrigued.\nExits.\n\n\nINT. KITCHEN - DAY\n\nDelia is frantically preparing for the evening's dinner\nparty.  Lydia is very much in her way, trying to show\nher the photographs.  Delia isn't looking at them.\n\nDELIA\nI can't believe you are doing this\nto me!  Ghosts.  I am giving a\ndinner party for seven people\ntonight.  Otho has agreed to come\nback for the demolition of the\nattic.  My agent, Bernard, is\nbringing some woman who writes for\n\"Art in America.\"  In fact, no one\nhere tonight has not been in\n\"Vanity Fair.\"  Except you.\n\nLYDIA\n(resigned)\nI told them you were too mean to\nbe afraid.\n\nDELIA\nDon't you dare talk to others\nabout me.  I'm an artist!  The\nonly thing that scares me is being\nembarrassed in front of my\nfriends.  Do you know how hard it\nis to get civilized people to set\nfoot in this part of Connecticut?\nNot a solitary word of this\npubescent tripe to anyone.\n\nLydia exits angrily.\n\nCAMERA HINGES.  Barbara is watching, horrified at\nDelia's occupation of her (Barbara's) kitchen.  Adam\nappears.\n\nBARBARA\nLydia's trying, but they don't\nbelieve her.\n\nADAM\nShe's got photos, Barbara.\n\nBARBARA\nAdam, you had a photo of Big Foot!\n\nADAM\nThis is different.  Eventually\nshe'll take someone to the attic.\nAnd then what?  We've got to try\nto contact this guy Betelmyer.  We\ngotta get some help, hon.\n\n\nINT. ATTIC ROOM - LATER - DAY\n\nAdam looks intently through the book.\n\nBarbara's eye is caught by something in the model\ncemetery.  She moves over and sees a small gravestone\nlit up by neon.\n\nBARBARA\nAdam!\n\nAdam comes over.  Looks.\n\nADAM\nI didn't do that one... Hmmm.\n\nBARBARA\nIt's him.  Look... Betelgeuse...\nBetelgeuse...\n\nShe looks at Adam, \"should I?\" Adam chews his lip\nthoughtfully.\n\nADAM\nGo ahead... third time's a charm.\n\nBARBARA\n(after a deep breath)\nBetelgeuse!\n\nZAP!  They are transported into the model graveyard.\n\n\nEXT. INSIDE THE MODEL GRAVEYARD - NIGHT\n\nWIND BLOWS --  With shovels and lanterns, Adam and\nBarbara are unlikely gravediggers.  The mechanized\nclouds move in the sky across the mechanical moon,\nthrowing weird shadows everywhere.  Ground fog creeps\nslowly along the graves.  It is so eerie.\n\nBARBARA\nWhat happened?\n\nADAM\nThree times.  Powerful number.\n\nBARBARA\n(standing in front\nof grave)\nBet... el... geuse.  What an\nawful name.  I thought it was like\n-- you know.  The juice of\nbeetles.\n\nAdam cringes too.\n\nBARBARA\n(continuing)\nWhere is he?  What do we do?\n\nAdam looks down at the grave.  Knocks on the stone.\nNothing.\n\nADAM\nHas anything been simple so far?\nFrom the look of the shovel, we\ndig.\n\nBARBARA\nOh, Adam.  I don't have gloves.\nMy nails keep getting longer.\nI'll break them.\n\nHands her a shovel anyway.  She digs.\n\n\nEXT. INSIDE THE MODEL GRAVEYARD - LATER - NIGHT\n\nThey're almost down six feet.  By now they are both\nalmost out of sight in the grave.  Inside the grave --\nAdam suddenly hits wood.\n\nBARBARA\nIt's about time.\n\nThey lean down and brush dirt off a brass plate on the\ncoffin.\n\n\"BETELGEUSE\"\n\nADAM\nI guess we open it.\n\nBARBARA\nMaybe we should knock first?\n\nA slight TREMOR shakes them.  They look at each other\nand try to scramble from the grave.\n\n\nTOPSIDE\n\nThey just barely crawl out when a mouldering corpse\nsprings out of the grave and jumps on Barbara's back,\nand plants a thousand-year-old kiss on her lips.  She\nscreams and burbles.  Adam pulls the corpse off her\nback.  The corpse does a Three Stooges hammer on Adam's\nhead.\n\nAdam staggers backward, unhurt but shocked.  All three\nstop.\n\n\nON THE CORPSE\n\nSomething unreal about him, almost mechanical.  Then\nthe corpse, grinning insanely at them, flies straight\nup into the air over their heads.  He CRASHES against\nthe tombstone...\n\nAnd Adam and Barbara see the corpse is only a huge\nmarionette on a string and pole.  A LAUGH comes from\nbehind the gravestone.\n\n\nPUPPETEER BETELGEUSE\n\nsteps out.  He looks like someone who just crawled out\nfrom under a rock.  This is one slippery customer.\nBetelgeuse speaks in a rapid polyglot, choosing words\nand phrases from every slang in the world.  Barbara is\nmighty uneasy.\n\nBETELGEUSE\nAll right.  Who are you?\n\nBARBARA\nWe're...\n\nBETELGEUSE\nYou're the dead.\n\nADAM\nAren't you dead?\n\nBETELGEUSE\nHell no!  I'm rolling.  I'm a\nbusinessman.  I'm the man what\nam.  Beeetel Jooose!  Who\ndo I gotta kill?\n\nADAM\nYou don't kill anyone.\n\nBARBARA\nJust get some people out of our\nhouse.\n\nBETELGEUSE\nBio busting.  I love it.  Who do\nI gotta kill?  Family -- right?\nObnoxious, I bet.\n(contorting face)\nMommie, daddy, piglets.\n\nBARBARA\nJust one daughter.\n\nBETELGEUSE\nHey you've been on Saturn!\n(brushing yellow dust\noff her)\nI hate those Sandworms!  Yecchhh!\nI've lost a lot of buddies to\nSandworms.\n(back to work)\nSo a daughter?  She got good legs?\nGod I love a young leg.\n\nAir blows up Barbara's dress, exposing her legs.  He\nleers.\n\nBARBARA\nShe's only fourteen...\n\nADAM\n... acts like she's thirty-five.\n\nBETELGEUSE\n(rubbing hands)\nHow does she feel about short old\nmen with dirty ears?\n\nBarbara is grossed out and increasingly uneasy.  Beetle\nJuice senses it and gets back to business.\n\nBETELGEUSE\nSo you, the dead, want me, the\nundead, to throw the live guys --\nMommie, Daddy and Lolita, who\nmight not mind a tumble with an\nolder guy, out into the cold?\nEven though they have paid hard\ncasharoonie for your dump?\n\nADAM\nBut... the Deetzes are destroying\nour house.\n\nBETELGEUSE\n(scolding sarcasm)\nYou Maitlands are the backbone of\nthe afterlife.  So what's my cut?\n\nADAM\nCan you scare them off?\n\nBeetle Juice looks offended.\n\nBETELGEUSE\nMe, scary?  You be the judge.\n\n\nANGLE\n\nHe swirls his face and shoulders into a horrifying\nimage.  Pleased, he laughs at himself.\n\nBARBARA\n(decisively)\nHoney.  Let's go.\n\nADAM\nGo?  What d'ya mean?  We need\nhelp.\n\nBARBARA\nNo, we don't.  We can work\nsomething out ourselves.  We just\nhave to try harder.\n\nBETELGEUSE\nHold on.  Let's not be squeamish,\nmissy.  You rang my bell, you\ngotta lick the pump.  I'm rolling!\n\n\nBARBARA\n\ngrabs Adam.  Betelgeuse is getting mad.  Not pretty.\n\nBETELGEUSE\nFolks, be reasonable here.  I'm at\nyour service.  You be the judge.\nI'm a harmless guy.  Try me.\n\nBARBARA\nHome.  Home.  Home!\n\n\nZAP\n\nThey are gone.  Betelgeuse is furious.\n\nBETELGEUSE\nYou fresh corpse creeps!  Who do\nyou think you are?... Walking\naway from a professional?\n\n\nBETELGEUSE\n\nwalks to a tree and kicks it hard.  The whole huge tree\nfalls, KABLOOM!\n\n\nINT. ATTIC - DAY\n\nA small tree falls in the model.  Adam, across the\nroom, walks over and straightens it.\n\nHe looks at Barbara who is poring over the handbook.\nMaking notes.  Counting out procedures.\n\nADAM\nHoney, I think that was a mistake.\n\nBARBARA\nI am not going to expose that\nlittle girl to that... pervert\ndown there.\n\nADAM\nHow'd you do that?\n\nBARBARA\n(proud of herself)\nJust a hunch... remember things\ncome in threes -- three times in,\nthree times out... I'm getting the\nhang of this stuff.\n\nADAM\nI think we really pissed him off.\n\nBARBARA\nI don't care...\n\nADAM\nBut we let him out.\n\nBARBARA\nI've changed my mind... I feel\nreally confident.  We're getting\nbetter at this stuff.  We can\nscare them off ourselves --\ntonight!  I've got an idea.\nYou're going to love it... I'm\ngoing to hate it.\n\n\nADAM\n\nturns to look down at the model again.  Straightens the\ntree.  Turns away.  We can see a tiny light moving\nthrough the tiny model forest towards the house.\n\nADAM (V.O.)\nOkay.  But that Betelgeuse sure\nseemed mad.\n\nBETELGEUSE (V.O.)\n(singing)\nHi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I\ngo!\n\n\nINT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nDinner for seven, as promised.  Everything looks very\nnice.  Deetzes are in control and in their element.\nThe element is neurotic-chic.\n\nSome of the guests are affecting distaste for having\nhad to make the long drive to Connecticut.  There's a\nbitchy feud going on between GRACE, the \"Art In Amer-\nica\" writer, and BERNARD, Delia's agent, that threatens\nto become a full-scale war.\n\nOtho is drunkish and engaged in his third favorite\noccupation -- direct attacks on the personal weaknesses\nof his friends.  He's singled out his victim, BERYL,\nthe editor for Ballantine, a frail-looking woman who is\ndressed \"artistically.\"\n\nOTHO\n(to Beryl)\nWell, darling, you can only have a\nhysterectomy once, so why don't you\ntell us what you really went into\nthe hospital for last week?  Or dare\nI ask, is that a nose \"nouveau?\"\n\nCHARLES\n(privately; to\nOtho)\nOtho, you've got to help me get\nMaxie Dean up here.  I have a deal\nthat could make all of us very\ncomfortable.\n\nOTHO\nHe's a cloven-hooved beast!\n\nCHARLES\nHe's your cousin.\n\nOTHO\nI am ashamed to say he is.  Look,\nnothing short of giving away free\nsacks of money would get him up\nhere, Charles.  And Sarah?  Forget\nit.  You can't get her out of\nBergdorf's with plastic explosives.\n(still on Beryl's\ncase)\nI just hope it wasn't yet another of\nyour dreary suicide attempts.  You\nknow what they say about people who\nwho commit suicide.  In the afterlife,\nthey become civil servants.\n\nBERNARD\nOtho!  I didn't know you were into\nthe supernatural?\n\nOTHO\nOf course you remember!  After my\nstint with the living theatre.  I\nwas one of New York City's leading\nparanormal researchers until the\nbottom dropped out of the business\nin '72.\n\nBERYL\n(sick to death of\nthis blowhard)\nParanormal... Is that what they're\ncalling your kind now?\n\nLydia watches Otho thoughtfully.  Suddenly very cur-\nious.\n\nDelia senses that Lydia might talk ghosts here.\n\nDELIA\n(a threat; quietly\nto Lydia)\nDon't you dare.\n\nLYDIA\nI saw some ghosts.\n\nAll quiet.\n\nDELIA\n(interrupting)\nLydia tried to play a most\namusing joke on me this afternoon.\n\nLYDIA\nIt wasn't a joke.\n\nDELIA\nTried to convince me that this\nhouse is haunted.  Kids.  Kids.\nKids!  I love them.\n\nOtho's glance sharpens at this.  Everyone else listens.\n\nGRACE\nBy ghosts?\n\nLYDIA\nBy what else?\n\nDELIA\n(laughing it away)\nIn sheets yet.  Designer sheets.\nThey --\n\nCharles, seeing things aren't going well for Delia,\nproposes a toast.\n\nCHARLES\nI propose a toast to our intrepid\nfriends.  Who braved the\nexpressway and fourteen toll\nbooths to visit us.  May your\nbuildings go condo.\n\nAll lift their wineglasses.  All drink.  All synchro-\nnously spit out their wine.  All together now...\n\nEVERYONE\nYechhh!\n\nCharles lifts the wine bottle from the cooler.  Disgust\nspans the room.\n\nON bottle -- it bears the familiar spread wings of\nThunderbird!\n\nBERYL\nThunderbird wine?  My God, Delia,\ndon't you even have a Safeway up\nhere?\n\nDELIA\n(horrified; but\nrecovering)\nJoke Joke!  Charles get the good\nwine and I'll serve the shrimp.\nIt's a joke.\n\nDelia stares a spike through Lydia.  Delia and Charles\nrush into the kitchen.  Otho looks at his glass and\npeers at Lydia.\n\n\nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\nDelia rushes to get the sushi.  Charles finds some\ngood wine.\n\nDELIA\n(rapidly; furious)\nLydia switched wines.  Charles --\nif you do not agree right now, to\nboarding school, you can forget\nhaving what you call sex -- ever\nagain in your natural lifetime.\n\nHe nods reluctantly.  She rushes back to guests.\n\n\nINT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nLydia is looking around curiously.  Delia and Charles\nrush back in with sushi and good wine.  Delia pours for\nBernard, the obvious connoisseur.  He tastes the wine.\nAll wait.  Is it Kerosene du Pape?  He smiles.  All\nsmile.\n\nOtho is more interested in Lydia's story.  He leans\ntoward her...\n\nOTHO\nNow, Lydia... Favor us about your\nghosts.\n\nDELIA\nNo!  Do not encourage this\nlittle... person.\n\nOTHO\nOh, Delia, lighten up!\n\nDELIA\nShe's been without therapy up here\nand I will not allow her to\nruin...\n\nBut then:\n\n\nDELIA\n\nSomething comes over her -- she straightens, then\ncrouches a little, her hand sweeps across in front of\nher, almost mechanically.  And then our Delia Deetz,\nunable to help herself, leaves the whitebread world\nbehind and possessed, sings in someone else's voice, a\nrich, NEGRO TENOR.\n\nDELIA\n\"If I didn't care, More than\nwords could say.\"\n\nLydia's eyes widen.  MUSIC UP.  All the guests are\nspellbound.\n\nCharles, too, has the beat -- The Ink Spots in his eyes.\nIn a voice not his own.\n\nCHARLES\n\"If my every prayer, did not\nbegin and end with just your\nname.\"\n\nDelia is shocked.  She looks at Lydia.\n\nDELIA\nFor God's sake, stop me...\n\nShe is cut short by her powerful inspiration.\n\nDELIA\n\"I could not be true to you\nbeyond compare.\"\n\n\nALL THE GUESTS\n\nexcept Lydia, are possessed to become the chorus.  They\nstand by their chairs, they spin in perfect Motown\nchoreography.\n\nEVERYONE\n(except Lydia)\n\"Shoo doo wop.  Shoo doo wop.\"\n\nDELIA\n\"If I didn't care... for you...\"\n\nEVERYONE\n\"Shoo doo wop.  Shoo doo wop.\"\n\nA look of sheer delight comes across Lydia's face,\nunlike anything we have previously seen.  She dances\nand claps her hands in time with the music.  She is in\nteen heaven.\n\nNOTE:  Delia and the guests are fully aware of their\nsinging/actions, but helpless to stop themselves.  While\nit is funny, it is nevertheless just a little frighten-\ning.\n\nLydia excitedly looks around the room to see if she can\nsee the ghosts.  She can't.\n\nNow the song pauses... Everyone tries to recover for a\nshocked second.  Instead, the tempo changes.\n\nAs the tempo quickens, the guest/chorus is syncopated\nlike alternating pistons as they are pushed and pulled\ninto their chairs.  They sing throughout.\n\n\nTHE SONG\n\ncrashes to its end.  Bernard looks down at his shrimp\ncocktail.  The shrimp draped over the rice roll\nsuddenly rears up like a hand and, making a tiny fist,\ngrabs his dangling tie and... smash --\n\nWIDER -- All the guests are punched by the shrimp, back\nover their chairs to the ground.  They are stunned.\nSuddenly everyone runs frightened into the next room.\n\n\nEXT./INT. ATTIC ROOM - NIGHT\n\nAdam and Barbara with huge smiles on their faces, dance\nthe bugaloo then hug and kiss on the landing in front\nof the attic.  Door is open.\n\nTOGETHER\nWe did it!\n\nADAM\nLet's watch 'em scatter.\n\nThey enter the attic and run to the window.  Look out\nover the front yard.\n\n\nYARD OF HOUSE - THEIR POV - NIGHT\n\nfilled with the cars of the guests, as well as Delia\nand Charles' vehicles.\n\nADAM (O.S.)\nAny minute now.  They'll all run\nscreaming.\n\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nThey wait.  Nothing moving outside.\n\nBARBARA\nYour Ink Spots were wonderful!\n\nAdam smiles proudly.\n\nADAM\nAnd your shrimp was remarkable.\n\nBARBARA\nMy shrimp?  I did the wine.\nDidn't you do the sushi?\n\nADAM\nN... No, I just did the Ink Spots.\n\nBARBARA (V.O.)\nWho did the?\n\nTimid KNOCK at the door of the attic.\n\nBarbara glances at Adam.  They don't know what to do.\n\nLYDIA\n(from outside the\ndoor)\nIt's me.  Lydia.\n\nAdam, puzzled, goes to the door and opens it.  Lydia is\nstanding there, sheepish.\n\nLYDIA\n(continuing)\nThey'd like for you to come\ndownstairs.  Delia says you can\npick any sheets you want.\n\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nThe guests are sitting expectantly.  The photographs\nare being passed around.  The wheels are turning in\nCharles' mind --  he sees a gold mine.  Everyone speaks\nat once.\n\nDELIA\nIt does indicate a marvelously\nurbane sense of humor on the part\nof these ghosts -- that they\nactually appear in sheets!\n\nOTHO\nWe're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn\nhere, a very sophisticated pair.  We\nmust protect them, treat them with\nrespect.  Nurture them.\n\nCHARLES\nPeople will pay big money for\nthis.  Right, Grace?\n\nGRACE\n(nodding)\nCharles, I want to know why you\ndidn't tell me about this --\n\nDELIA\n(now changing her\ntune)\nWe were waiting for proof.\nLydia's photographs...\n\nCharles is scheming.\n\nBERNARD\n(skeptical)\nWhat are you all talking about?\nWe... we just got a little drunk,\nthat's all.\n\nOTHO\nNo matter how drunk you get, you\ncannot sound like the Ink Spots.\n(to Charles)\nCharles, this is it!  You can get\nMaxie Dean up here now.\n\nCharles plots and plans.\n\nOTHO\nHis wife Sarah loves the\nsupernatural.  I did a reading for\nher just last week.  Told her her\njowls would tighten soon.  I mean\nshe will make him sprint up here in\nhis helicopter if you can produce\nghosts for her.\n\nBERYL\nThe \"Enquirer\" has offered fifty\nthousand dollars for absolute\nproof of life after death.  I'll\nsend them over.\n\nBERNARD\nI'm Delia's agent!  I've lost\nmoney for years on her work.  If\nanything actually happened here,\nI'll handle it, thank you.  But\nnot until I see some real proof.\n\nLydia appears at the base of the stairs.  Everyone\nstops squabbling, looks at her expectantly.\n\nLYDIA\nThey don't want to come down.\n\nOTHO\nWhy not?\n\nBernard shakes his head as if all this were an elaborate\nhoax.  He harumphs!\n\nLYDIA\nI think the reason is they were\ntrying to scare you, and you\ndidn't get scared --\n\nDELIA\nOf course we weren't scared.\n(looking around)\nJust a little startled.  One of\nthose shrimp dropped down my\nKamali.\n\nBernard is now convinced this whole business was a put-\non.\n\nBERNARD\n(shaking his head)\nTotal collective hallucination.\n\nBERYL\nI was a little tipsie.\n\nDELIA\nThis was not a hallucination,\npeople.  This was real, really\ntotally real.\n\nGRACE\nOf course, they were rather\nspectacular effects -- for\nConnecticut, I mean.\n\nOTHO\nAll presences have a home space.  A\nplace where they live, so to speak.\nWhere do they hide out?\n\nLYDIA\n(reluctantly)\nThe attic.\n\nCHARLES\nThe attic room is locked --\n\nLYDIA\nThey're ghosts.  They do what they\nwant.\n\nOTHO\nFabulous!  Otho Fenlock's \"Locked\nDoor\" ghosts!  Probably committed\nsuicide up there -- hanging like\nbeeves from the rafters.  I'm\ntotally enchanted.\n\nBernard gathers Grace and Beryl and walks out the door.\n\nBERNARD\nDelia, you are a flake.  You have\nalways been a flake.  I'm packing\nup and going back to the tricks of\nthe city.  That I can manage.  If\nyou must frighten people, do it\nwith your sculpture.\n\nThey exit.  Delia is horrified and embarrassed.\n\nDELIA\nWait!  I'm going to get to the\nbottom of this!  Lydia, is this\nsome high-tech trick of yours?  I\nwant you to take us up there tout\nsweet!\n\n\nINT. LANDING OUTSIDE OF ATTIC\n\nDelia, Charles, Otho and Lydia -- creep, creep.\n\nDELIA\n(whispering)\nShhh.  They're in there?  God,\nthey live like animals.  This is\nwhere they've been hiding out?\n\nLydia nods.  Delia suddenly, brashly pounds on the\ndoor.\n\nDELIA\n(shouting)\nAll right, you dead people!  Come\non out, or we'll break down this\ndoor and drag you out on the ropes\nyou hanged yourself with!\n\nLYDIA\nShhhh.  They didn't commit\nsuicide.\n\nDELIA\nIt doesn't matter.\nWhat matters is I've got a roomful\nof guests down there, who think\nI'm a fraud.\n(to Lydia)\nI am going to teach you something\nhere Lydia.  You've got to take\nthe right tone in things like\nthis, or people -- whether they're\ndead or alive -- people will walk\nall over you.\n(loud)\nCome on out, or I will make death\nso miserable that you will wish\nyou had never lived!\n\nDelia pounds on door, which opens with an eerie CREAK.\n\n\nINT. ATTIC - DAY\n\nLydia is pushed in first.  She looks around.  Delia,\nCharles and Otho come in next, carefully.  One by one\nthey straighten up and look around.\n\nDELIA\n(whisper)\nSo where are they, Lydia?\n\nLydia shrugs, looks around.\n\nCHARLES\n(off-handedly)\nAnswer your mother.\n\nLYDIA\nListen, you guys.  These ghosts\nare really nice people.  I think\nwe scared them off.  Let's just\nleave them alone.  Okay?\n\nCharles is suddenly transfixed.  He stares at the\nmodel.\n\nCHARLES\nIt's the whole damn town.\n\nThey gather around.  Lydia is a little sad as she looks\nat the empty room and the model.\n\nOTHO\nLook at that detail!\n\nDELIA\nLook at the tiny figures.\n\nCHARLES\nLook at all that parking!\n\nLYDIA\nCome on.  Leave their stuff alone.\n\nOTHO\nThey're not here, Lydia?\n\nShe shakes her head.  Otho spots the handbook.  Palms\nit.\n\nDELIA\nI have never been so\nembarrassed... They haven't gone\nfor good, have they?\n\nDelia is suddenly out the door, urging them all outside.\n\nDELIA\n(continuing)\nEveryone out of there.  If they're\nin there somewhere, I don't want\nto scare them away.  Come on now,\nstay out of there.  We've got work\nto do.\n\nOtho pockets the handbook secretly as everyone exits.\nDelia carefully closes the door.\n\n\nCAMERA EASES OVER TO THE WINDOW\n\nWe see two pairs of hands, white-knuckled, gripping the\nwindow sill from the outside.\n\n\nEXT. HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nBarbara and Adam are hanging outside the window.\nCAMERA EASES BACK to see that instead of hanging from\nthe house --\n\nThey are hanging from a ledge over The Inferno --\n\n\nON INFERNO\n\ncircles of rosy hell.  Several devilish Monsters slaver\nup at them, hoping for new meat for the furnace.  Small\ngeysers spurt foul gasses.\n\n\nWINDS\n\nBLOW hard on Adam and Barbara.  They struggle to hold\non and pull themselves back up and into the window.\n\nADAM\nJuno, help!  Juno!\n\nAfter nearly falling, Adam barely saves Barbara and\nthey finally make it up, and disappear into the window.\n\n\nINT. ATTIC LANDING - NIGHT\n\nDelia, Charles and Otho all start down the stairs, one\nby one.  All are holding the handrail.\n\nDELIA\nLydia, I will never forgive you\nfor embarrassing me in front of my\nsocial inferiors.  You help us\nwith these ghosts or you'll be\nsorry.\n\nLYDIA\nI'm sorry already.\n\nCHARLES\n(fixing on Otho)\nNow, let's get back to business.  I\nI want to get Maxie Dean and Sarah\nup here immediately.  I can make\nhistory here!  I'm going to turn\nthis sleepy little backward town\ninto a leading supernatural\nresearch center... and amusement\npark.\n\nLYDIA\n(disgusted)\nI cannot believe this.\n\nCHARLES\nDelia will cook...\n\nDelia glares at him.\n\nCHARLES\n(continuing)\nI'll bring the wine... and the\nbusiness plan.  And Lydia --\nyou'll bring the ghosts.\n\nLYDIA\n(frustrated)\nI can't bring the ghosts.  They're\nnot here!\n\nCHARLES\n... Otho, could you actually... do\nsomething with them?\n\nOTHO\n(pats the handbook\nunder his coat)\nPerhaps... if I were properly\nmotivated...\n\nLYDIA\nThat's slavery and murder.  You\ndon't know them.  They're nice\npeople!\n\nPOV -- down the handrail, as they walk downstairs.\nLydia lags behind, sullen.\n\n\nLOWER END OF THE HANDRAIL\n\nlifts, and turns.  The handrail has become a long, fat,\ndiamond-backed snake -- unlike any we have ever seen.\nIt flashes terrifying steel teeth and a red-feathered\ncomb.  It turns and HISSES at them.\n\n\nON DELIA\n\nShe screams as she looks down at her hand on the rail\n-- it grips the scaly, throbbing, dripping body of the\nsnake.\n\n\nTHE SNAKE\n\njust gets longer and nastier as it turns back in the\nair, up the stairs toward them.  Its tail circles Delia\nand spins her like a top.  When she stops -- the snake\ngives her a big wet snake kiss.\n\n\nSNAKE\n\nsnaps Otho in the behind.  It hurts.\n\n\nTHE SNAKE\n\nrears up and spreads a red-comb and HISSES loudly.\n\n\nALL THREE\n\nof them fall over each other trying to escape.\n\n\nTHE SNAKE\n\nhovers horribly over them.  Grabs Charles in its coils\nand squeezes him hard -- his fearful face reddens, then\nit suspends Charles over the edge of the stairs.\n\nSNAKE\nWe've come for your daughter,\nChuck!\n\n\nHE\n\nleers at Lydia and drops Charles like a rock over the\nbannister.  Charles screams.\n\n\nTHE SNAKE\n\nGrins at a terrified Lydia.\n\n\nSNAKE\n\nrears back for a strike, when suddenly, like thunder.\nOne word is heard.\n\nBARBARA\nBetelgeuse!  Betelgeuse!\nBetelgeuse!\n\n\nTHE SNAKE\n\nlooks up with familiar eyes.  At top of stairs stands\nan angry Barbara.\n\nWhat happens next is almost too fast for the eye to\nsee.\n\n\nTHE SNAKE\n\nshrinks and turns back into the regular mahogany hand-\nrail.\n\n\nBETELGEUSE\n\nor his outline, whips up the stairs, through the door,\nand is gone like a rocket.\n\nBETELGEUSE\nRRRatt shit!\n\n\nOTHO AND DELIA\n\nrush downstairs -- Lydia is terrified.  She runs away.\n\nLYDIA\nI hate you!  I thought you were my\nfriends.\n\nBARBARA\nNo, wait!\n\nLydia screams and runs down the stairs.\n\nLYDIA\n(screams)\nI hate all of you!\n\nSlowly, Barbara returns to the attic.\n\n\nINT. ATTIC - NIGHT\n\nAdam and Barbara are exhausted.  Agitated.\n\nADAM\nGreat choice we've got here.  We\nget to spend the next century\neither hanging out that window or\ndoing parlor tricks.\n\nAdam is working with the model town.  Barbara is pac-\ning.\n\nADAM\nMaybe they'll leave now.  That\nsnake was a pretty nasty customer.\n\nBARBARA\nHe might have hurt somebody.\n\nADAM\nBut he didn't.  We've got him\nwhere we want him.\n\n\nON THE MODEL\n\nA column of water shoots high in the air.\n\nAdam rushes over to the model -- looks down.\n\n\nINT. MODEL - DAY\n\nBetelgeuse has run a beat-up old pickup into a fire\nhydrant.  He stands nearby, hopping mad; shakes his\nfist at Adam.\n\nBETELGEUSE\nYou pansy-assed cretins!  How dare\nyou do that to me.  I coulda\nfinished the job!\n\n\nIN THE ATTIC\n\nBarbara and Adam, obviously disturbed, look at one\nanother with concern.\n\nBETELGEUSE (V.O.)\n(thin and pip-\ning voice)\nWhy did you stop me?\n\nBARBARA\nI don't like Charles Deetz\nparticularly, but you could have\nkilled him.\n\nBETELGEUSE\nHey, I've been bottled up for six\nhundred years.  Every dog has his\nday.  This is my town.  I need a\nnight to howl.\n\nADAM\nThis is my town.\n\nBETELGEUSE\nYou wish!  I nearly scored with\nthat little blonde.  I need me a\nshort little queen.\n\n\nANGLE\n\nAngry, Barbara reaches down into the model and plucks\nBetelgeuse up.\n\nBarbara lifts him up toward her, squeezing him\nslightly.\n\nBARBARA\nYou leave her alone, you horrid\nlittle prick!\n\n\nCLOSEUP - BETELGEUSE IN BARBARA'S HAND\n\nBetelgeuse grins.  Suddenly large spikes shoot out all\nover his body, piercing the skin of Barbara's palm and\nfingers.  Barbara's blood is a rich pink.\n\nShe squeals and releases the evil spirit and he plum-\nmets.\n\n\nEXT. MODEL - DAY\n\nBetelgeuse lands on the town common.  Betelgeuse is\ndefiant.\n\nBETELGEUSE\nGo ahead.  Make my millenium!\n\n\nANGLE\n\nWe hear the tinny strains of \"Honky Tonk Angel\" as if\nfrom down the street.  He turns around to follow it.\n\nBETELGEUSE\nThis burg got a cathouse?  I'm\ngetting anxious if you know what I\nmean.  Six hundred years and all.\n\nHe turns the corner to a whorehouse, with women --\nwomen with demon horns -- hanging out of the window,\nbeckoning.  Betelgeuse rubs his hands together and\nswaggers inside.\n\n\nINT. ATTIC - DAY\n\nBarbara aghast, watching this from above.\n\nBARBARA\nAdam!  Why did you build a whore\nhouse?  Have you ever been to...?\n\nADAM\nI didn't --\n\n\nANGLE\n\nHe doesn't finish -- a strong WIND blows through the\nattic, nearly knocking Barbara and Adam over.  They\nclose their eyes against the gale.\n\nWhen they open their eyes again, they're no longer in\nthe attic.  They're in --\n\n\nINT. JUNO'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY\n\nA cubicle in a much larger office.  Miss Argentina\nswishes by.\n\nRECEPTIONIST\nGod, you have got her steaming\nnow.\n\nShe exits.  There are other special workers.  The place\nis really, really busy.  Adam and Barbara sit down to\nwait.  Juno storms through with a sheaf of papers.  She\nsees them.  She is steaming mad.\n\nJUNO\nThe whorehouse was my idea.  I\nwant Betelgeuse out of the\npicture!  We've got some serious\ntalking to do.\n\nBARBARA\nAbout what?\n\nJUNO\nYou people have really screwed\nup!  I received word that you\nallowed yourselves to be\nphotographed.  And you let\nBetelgeuse out and didn't put him\nback, and you let Otho get ahold\nof the handbook.\n\nADAM\nHandbook?  When...?\n\nJUNO\n(continuing tirade)\nNever trust the living!  We cannot\nhave a routine haunting like yours\nprovide incontrovertible visual\nproof of existence beyond death.\n\nADAM\nWell, we didn't know --\n\n\nA BUNCH OF FOOTBALL PLAYERS\n\nfollow Juno like hungry dogs.\n\nDUMB #1\nHey, Coach, where's the men's\nroom?\n\nJUNO\n(frustrated)\nI'm not your coach.  He survived.\n\nDUMB #2\nYou don't need a men's room.\nYou're not no man no more.  But\nCoach, let me get this -- What's\nour curfew over here?\n\nThey start squabbling.  Juno has to wrangle them into\nanother room.\n\nJUNO\n(frustrated)\nI'll be right back.\n\n\nINT. KITCHEN - DAY\n\nCharles sits at the table with a small bandage on his\nhead.  Delia takes off her Gucci belt and whips it on a\nchair absent-mindedly.\n\nDELIA\nI feel like we've been at war,\nCharles.\n\nCHARLES\nAt least insofar as we have our\nfirst casualty.  Me.\n\nDELIA\nOtho'll know what to do.\n\nCHARLES\nWhat's he going to do?  Viciously\nrearrange their environment?\n\nDELIA\nOtho knows just as much about the\nsupernatural as he knows about\ninterior design.\n\nCHARLES\nLet's hope he knows how to produce\nthose damn ghosts for Max and\nSarah... Because I've bought\noptions on property all over town.\nI need Max's financing...\n\nDELIA\nJust don't tell Lydia.\n\nCHARLES\nWhy not?\n\nDELIA\nI think she's in with them.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n\nINT. LYDIA'S BEDROOM - DAY\n\nIt's dark.  The bedroom curtains have been closed.\nDRAMATIC OPERA MUSIC builds throughout.\n\nLydia melodramatically dressed in a long black dress\nappears carrying a candle.  She is softly crying.\n\nShe sits at her dressing table, the candlelight shows\nher writing paper.  She begins a very dramatic letter.\n\nLYDIA\nI am alone.\n\nShe looks at it and crumpling the paper, starts again.\n\nLYDIA\n(continuing)\nI am utterly... alone.  You have\nsealed my fate with your betrayal.\nI can no longer stand to be used\nlike a puppet between two\ndeceitful worlds.  By the time you\nread this, I will be gone, having\njumped off...\n\nShe scratches that out.\n\nLYDIA\n(continuing)\n... having plummeted off the\nWinter River Bridge.  Then you\nwill know that I am no longer a\ntoy in your petty feuds.  Goodbye,\nLydia.\n\nA tear falls on the paper as she folds it and puts it\nin an envelope.  OPERA MUSIC BUILDS AND CONTINUES.\n\n\nINT. CHARLES' OFFICE - DAY\n\nLydia slowly makes a copy of the suicide note.  The\ngreen of the Xerox light falls eerily on her sad face.\n\n\nINT. HALLWAY - DAY\n\nLydia at bottom of attic stairs.\n\n\nLYDIA'S POV - STAIRS AND DOOR AT TOP\n\nThey look ominous.  She starts upward.\n\n\nINT. ATTIC ROOM - DAY\n\nThe door opens and Lydia peers in.\n\nThe room is empty.  Lydia comes inside.\n\nLYDIA\nAre you here?\n\nShe hears SOMETHING.  Looks all around the room.\nNothing.\n\nLYDIA\n(continuing)\nMr. and Mrs. Maitland?  I've come\nfor the last time?\n(laying note on\ntable)\nWhere are you?  Barb...\n\nBETELGEUSE (V.O.)\nThey're dead.\n\nLydia looks around, then peers into model.\n\nBETELGEUSE (V.O.)\n(continuing)\nThink small.  I'm talking to you.\n\n\nEXT. MODEL TOWN - BUILDING ROOF - DAY\n\nA tiny Betelgeuse on the roof of a building, wearing a\nsilk dressing gown, looking like he just dragged him-\nself out of bed.  One of the horned whores is nude,\nsunbathing in the corner, and Betelgeuse drapes a\nblanket over her.  Lydia's face looms enormous in the\nsky.\n\nBETELGEUSE\nCookie, they are dead, dead,\ndeadski.\n\nLYDIA\nOf course they're dead.  They're\nghosts.\n\nBETELGEUSE\nNo, I mean they've gone.\nDecamped.  Split.  Vanished.\n\nLYDIA\nWhere'd they go?\n\nBETELGEUSE\nThe happy hunting ground.  Who\ncares?\n\nLYDIA\nAre you a spirit too?\n\nBETELGEUSE\nSort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh.\nListen, cookie, I've been trapped\nin this burg for hundreds of\nyears.  All I want is to get out.\n\nLYDIA\nI want to get in.\n\nBETELGEUSE\nYou do?  Over here?  On my side?\n\nLYDIA\nI think so.\n\nBETELGEUSE\n(scheming quickly)\nWell, yes, of course.  It's great\nover here.  You'll meet all the\ngreats.  James Dean.  Sid\nVicious...\n\nLYDIA\nWell, it can't be any worse than\nmy life here.\n\nBETELGEUSE\n(sinister, encouraging\nher)\nThat's right.  They treat you like\nscum, I bet?\n\nLYDIA\nYeah.\n\nBETELGEUSE\nI can't help you from this side,\nbut here's how we do it.  So\nsimple.  Say my name three\ntimes.  That's all.  I'll be all\nyours.  Then I'll bring you over\nhere in style.\n\nLYDIA\nI... I don't know what your name is.\n\nBETELGEUSE\nMinor problem.  The rules.  I\ncan't tell it to you.  But.. do\nyou know how to play charades?\n\nLYDIA\nYes.\n\nBETELGEUSE\nOf course you do.\n\nHe holds up two fingers in a V.\n\nLYDIA\nTwo words.\n\nBetelgeuse holds up one finger.\n\nLYDIA\n(continuing)\nFirst word.\n\nBetelgeuse puts two fingers on his arm.\n\nLYDIA\n(continuing)\nThree syllables.\n\nBETELGEUSE\nNo, dummy.  Two.\n\nLYDIA\nYour fingers are so small I can't\nsee them.  First word -- two\nsyllables.\n\nHe points behind her.\n\nLYDIA\n(continuing)\nI don't know what that signal\nmeans.\n\nBETELGEUSE\nIt means look behind you, bimbo.\n\n\nANGLE\n\nLydia looks behind her.  A greet beetle the size of a\nVolkswagen is crouching.  Its feathery antennae reach\nout toward her menacingly.  Lydia yelps.\n\nLYDIA\nBeetle!\n\nBETELGEUSE\nGood girrrl!\n\nPOP!  The beetle disappears.  Betelgeuse holds up two\nfingers.\n\nLYDIA\n(still shaken)\nSecond word.  Be careful.\n\n\nANGLE\n\nApprehensive, she jumps when a simple carton of orange\njuice materializes.  Orange juice pours out into a\nghostly glass.\n\nLYDIA\nBreakfast?  Orange?\n\nThe orange juice disappears.  He shakes his head.\n\nLYDIA\nBreakfast beetle?  Beetle?  Beetle\nfruit?  Fruit bat?  Fruit Battle?\nVolkswagen?  Fruit wagon?\n\nBETELGEUSE\nGood thing you are a beautiful\nkid.  You are dumb!\n\nBetelgeuse does the signal for \"Now Put Them Together.\"\n\nLYDIA\nI am not!  Beetle... Juice?\n\nBETELGEUSE\n(jumping with delight)\nThat's it!\n\nLYDIA\nYour name is Beetle Juice?  Yecch!\nThat's as bad as Deeelia Deeetz.\n\nBETELGEUSE\nIt's spelled different, but\nbasically... Now you said it\ntwice, just one more time.  And\nI'll be free.\n(sinister)\nAnd then you'll be free.\n\nLydia, puzzled, gets the magnifying glass and peers at\nhim.\n\n\nON HIS UGLY FACE BIG IN THE GLASS\n\nBetelgeuse jumps in the air, his robe parts -- we don't\nsee anything, but maybe Lydia does.\n\nLYDIA\nGod, you're anatomically correct!\n\nBETELGEUSE\nJust say it.\n\nLYDIA\n(recognizing something\nabout him)\nYou were the snake!  Right?  I\nknow.  It was you.\n\nBETELGEUSE\nYou've got to say it!\n\nLYDIA\nNo I don't.  I don't take orders\nfrom Smurfs.\n\nBETELGEUSE\nHow'd you like to be married to...\nthe King...?\n\nLydia doesn't get it.\n\nBETELGEUSE\n(continuing)\n... Elvis?...\n(boasting)\nYou know, ever since he came over\nhe and I have been just like this.\n(crosses his fingers)\nI can arrange it.  Just say my\nname one more time.\n\nShe thinks about that one.  Shakes her head.\n\nLYDIA\nNo, No... I need to talk to\nBarbara.\n\nBetelgeuse smiles.\n\nBETELGEUSE\nWell, cookie, just say my name.  I\ncan get her.\n(rubbing his horny little\nhands together)\nThat and so much more...\n\nLydia walks around thinking for a moment.\n\nLYDIA\nWho else did you say is over\nthere?\n\n\nINT. JUNO'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nJuno staring at them, hard.\n\nJUNO\nYes... or no?  Do you want the\nDeetzes out or in?\n\nADAM\nOut.\n\nBARBARA\nWhat about Betelgeuse?\n\nJUNO\nForget him.  He'll remain with his\nwhores until someone calls him.\nYou need to worry about people like\nOtho.  There are a lot of\nphony trance mediums.  They\nusually can't make the formulas\nwork, but if Otho stumbles on the\nright words in that handbook... he\ncould hurt you.  As in --\nexorcism.\n\nThey both look puzzled.\n\nJUNO\n(continuing)\nIn plain English -- that's death\nfor the dead.  I don't care what\nit takes, just get them out of\nthere now.  It's not pretty, but\n-- that's death!\n\nAdam stands to go.\n\nJUNO\n(continuing)\nWait a minute.  Let's see what\nyou're going to do...\n\nThey look at Juno.\n\nJUNO\n(continuing)\n... to scare her.  I want to make\nsure it's not some silly parlor\ntrick.\n\nBarbara looks at Adam.\n\nADAM\nI'll do the hard part, hon.\n\n\nADAM\n\nreluctantly pulls on his face, and contorts it into a\nliving, breathing, horror.  Juno is even a little\nrepulsed.\n\nJUNO\nNot bad.  Not bad.  Now you?  Go\nahead.\n\n\nANGLE\n\nShe reluctantly does with her face a minor version of\nAdam's horror.\n\nJUNO\n(continuing)\nOkay.  You look great!  Now go\nclean house.  And don't forget the\nphotographs and the damned\nhandbook.\n\n\nANGLE\n\nBarbara and Adam slowly stand and walk out the door.\nBarbara/Monster looks back pleadingly.  Football\nplayers flood into Juno's office.  One PARTICULARLY\nDUMB PLAYER has a revelation.  (He's pretty grisly,\nmaybe sat too close to the engine.)\n\nPARTICULARLY DUMB PLAYER\nCoach!  Coach, I don't think we\nsurvived the crash!\n\nBarbara and Adam look at each other and continue out the\ndoor.\n\n\nOUTSIDE JUNO'S OFFICE\n\nThey enter a long dark hallway.  They suddenly find\nthemselves standing in front of Lydia's room.  Adam/\nMonster looks at Barbara/Monster as he grabs the door-\nknob.  She stops him.  Tears fall down her sad ghostly\nface.\n\nBARBARA\nAdam.  I can't do it.  I like that\nlittle girl.\n\nADAM/MONSTER\nIt's too late.  Sometimes things\njust work out this way.  We have\nto, honey.\n\nBARBARA/MONSTER\nNo we don't.  We can rebel or\nsomething.  We'll just stay up\nthere in our room.  I'll read, you\ncan build on the model.  Come on.\n\nShe rushes up the stairs, toward the attic.  He follows\nher.\n\nADAM/MONSTER\nWait.  We can't, honey.  Our\nhouse...\n\nShe gets to the door.

ATTIC - NIGHT\n\nLydia screams, Adam/Monster tries to calm her.  Lydia\nstruggles and, thinking she is being attacked, runs out\nthe door.  Smack into Barbara/Monster.\n\nBarbara catches her, frightens Lydia even more.\nBarbara holds onto her as she struggles.  Barbara/\nMonster slowly changes back into regular Barbara.\nLydia sees who it is and she hugs her.  Like mother and\ndaughter.\n\nON ADAM - slowly returning to himself.

No... Lydia... Why?\n\nLYDIA\n(after a pause,\ndramatically\nbut for real)\nLife is just... unliveable...\n\nBarbara hugs her.  She fumbles for words.  This is an\nunusual situation, a dead person talking a live person\nout of killing herself.  She rocks Lydia a little.\nBarbara looks at Adam.\n\nBARBARA\nLydia, believe me... we know...\nall the hard stuff is the same\nover here.  You're going to be who\nyou are... whether you're alive or\ndead... and over here -- it's...\nIt's flat... there's no food, no\ncolors... you can't smell the\nflowers.\n(thinking)\nIf we knew then what we know\nnow... we'd have been more\ncareful...\n\nADAM\n(in the style of the\ndead receptionist)\n... we wouldn't have had our\nlittle accident.\n\nLydia looks at Barbara lovingly.\n\nBARBARA\nSo never let Beetlejuice out --\nnever.

He is trying to\nchange back into Adam, except for his nose, which\nremains like a beak for a minute.  Finally, it changes\ntoo.\n\nLydia and Barbara laugh at him.\n\n\nANGLE\n\nWithout noticing Lydia, Otho and Charles push in\nthrough the door and grab the model.

HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\nLydia runs through the hallway and into the dining\nroom.\n\n\nINT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nLydia walks into a presentation in progress.  Sitting\naround the table are Otho, Maxie, and Delia.  Sarah Dean\nis there, too.  She looks around Lydia hoping for\nghosts.  Sarah is heavily made up, smells bad.\n\nLydia's photos of the sheeted ghosts are blown up and\nstanding on a nearby easel.  Charles, over the model\nwith a pointer, is lost in mid-sentence.\n\nCHARLES\n-- In short, I've got options to\nbuy enough of Main Street to\ncontrol the city council for a\nhundred years.  And at the prices\nI'm talking about, if it all fell\napart tomorrow, we just move out and\nsell to the Arabs and we still come\nout... I've talked to Ed Cornwall\nabout a wax museum, here... in\nThanksgiving Park... Ed's the man\nwho made the talking Jesse Jackson\nstatue.\nAnd I've got a museum dedicated to\n50 Great Moments in the Paranormal\n-- and parenthetically, D-Con wants\nto the right to start an insect zoo\nhere in the old hardware store.\n(seeing Lydia)\nLydia, did you finally decide to\njoin us?\n\nThey all give her an oily smile.\n\nCHARLES\nHoney, I am just finishing the first\nphase presentation about our little\nproject here.  Then we'll take a\nstretch and invite our friends... to meet\nyour friends.\n\nSarah gets Maxie's attention and unable to contain her\nexcitement, silently urges him to get on with the\nghosts.\n\nSARAH\nAre they here yet?\n\nMAXIE\nYes, Charles, let's cut the\nbullcorn.  We're here to see\nghosts.  This whole ghost town\nmuseum and such like follows a\ntrain, if you've got the engine...\nso let's see your goddamned engine.\n\nEveryone looks at Lydia.\n\nLYDIA\nThey're... not here anymore.\n\nCHARLES\n(smiling apologetically)\nNonsense, every time she says\nthat, the paint peels, and some\nwild creature tries to kill us.\n\nSARAH\n(motioning)\nWe've got these pictures, Lydia.\n\nLYDIA\nNo, really... they said they might\ncome back and all of us could live\nin peace if you agreed not to\ntease them or make them do silly\ntricks.\n\nSarah is disappointed.  She goes to Maxie.  Delia takes\nover.\n\nDELIA\nShe's become a little emotional\nabout all this.  No counseling up\nhere.  But we aren't relying on\nher.  No, we rely on\nprofessionals.  We have... Otho.\n\nThe whole room turns to Otho.  Who is scribbling some-\nthing and mumbling.\n\nCHARLES\nAre they still here, Otho?\n\nOtho looks up; he missed the question.\n\nDELIA\nAre they still here, Otho?\n\nOTHO\nOh, they're still here.  They're\njust not showing up.\n\nCHARLES\nThey're probably guilty about what\nthey did to me.\n\nDELIA\nNot these people!  They are\nruthless!\n\nMAXIE\nI don't care from guilt.  I just\nwant to see them.\n\nCHARLES\nOtho, can you do it?\n\nOTHO\nIt's tricky, but I think I can\nhandle it.\n\nHe dramatically produces the handbook.\n\nLYDIA\nNo!\n\nLydia begins to think about this scene and she shifts\nto another point of view.\n\nLYDIA\nWait a minute!  What am I worried\nabout?  Otho, you can't even\nchange a tire!\n\nOTHO\n(taking the challenge)\nI'll need something personal of\ntheirs.\n\nLYDIA\nYou'll have to go to the Goodwill.\n\nDelia gets an idea.\n\n\nEXT.

Lays\nsomething out on the dining room table.\n\nDELIA\nI'm deeply sentimental about...\nweddings.\n\nLydia stands to see:  Delia carefully lays out\nBarbara's white wedding dress.  Then next to it, Adam's\nwedding tux.\n\nLydia looks at it.  A chill runs through her.\n\nLYDIA\n(hushed realization)\nTheir wedding clothes.\n\nOTHO\n(dramatically)\nTheir wedding clothes.\n\nOtho then holds up the handbook.\n\nSARAH\nThe \"words\".\n\nOtho nods.\n\n\nINT.

ATTIC - NIGHT\n\nBarbara with her arm on his shoulder, talks to Adam.\n\nBARBARA\nWe've been given a gift here,\nhoney.  A real live little girl.\nShe likes us a lot.  She needs\nus.  Maybe that's why we died so\nyoung, to keep us from getting\nso... attached to things.  The\nhouse, antiques, your model.  Look\nat us.  We didn't have room for\nanyone.\n\nADAM\n(after a long thought)\nWhat makes you think she likes me?\n\nBarbara slowly smiles.  He does too.\n\nHe turns to Barbara.

She turns to see:\n\n\nON THE DRESS\n\nBarbara's wedding dress floats over the table and fills\nslowly, painfully, with the arms, legs and finally the\nfrightened face of Barbara.  A lightning bolt flares.\n\nLydia rises slowly to her feet, unable to resist.\n\nMore lightning bolts.\n\nOTHO\nAs sudden thunder / Pierces the night;\nAs magic wonder / Mad affright\nRives asunder / Man's delight:\nOur ghost, our corpse and we\nRise to be.\n\nLydia walks slowly toward Barbara.\n\n\nON BARBARA\n\nShe is in pain, she is very slowly aging.  She speaks,\nbut no words can be heard.  Not even by Lydia.  But we\ncan see she is calling for... Adam.\n\nLYDIA\nStop it!\n\nMAXIE\nShhhh!\n\nLydia screams for Adam.\n\nLYDIA\nAdam.

No one is watching Lydia.\n\nON LYDIA -- tears well up in her eyes.\n\n\nON BARBARA\n\nShe is slowly aging.  Now a bewildered Adam appears,\nfloating in his wedding suit.  Seeing his Barbara, now\nolder than he is, Adam reaches for her hand...\n\nON HANDS -- as he grasps her hand, it seems to be made\nof white crepe; it wrinkles and nearly collapses.\n\nAdam... puzzled, calls her name silently.\n\nDELIA\nWhat's happening to them?\n\nOTHO\nI don't know.\n\nCHARLES\nAre they suffering?\n\nLYDIA\n(screams)\nThey're dying.\n\nMAXIE\nThey're already dead.  They can't\nfeel a thing.\n\nObviously not true.\n\nON BARBARA -- she looks down slowly at Lydia and with\neffort makes a loving smile.  She reaches out toward\nLydia.\n\nCompletely helpless now, Lydia weeps openly and then\nsomething comes over her.  She rushes across the room.\nStares down at the model.\n\nLYDIA\nWhere are you?

MODEL TOWN GRAVEYARD - NIGHT\n\nSomeone, or something, like the figure of death in the\nGoya drawing, is perched atop the gravestone of Barbara\nand Adam Maitland.  The graves beneath him are open.\nThe figure turns... it is Betelgeuse.  He is filing his\ntalons casually.\n\nHe speaks with a ghastly rasp.\n\nBETELGEUSE\nSo...

The sculptures twist\naround them, forcing them to watch the hideous\nspectacle.\n\nAdam and Barbara are rapidly trying to recover as the\nceremony begins.\n\n\nA DEATH-MASKED OLD PREACHER\n\nslides down the fireplace, ready to perform the\nservice, speaks with a hissing death rattle.\n\nPREACHER\nDo you, Betel...\n\nHis mouth drops and is frozen.\n\nBETELGEUSE\nUh-uh!

And I took pictures of\nthe new church for you, too.\n\nBARBARA\nHow'd you do on the science test?\n\nON LYDIA\n\nLYDIA\n(hangs her head)\nIt was gross.  They wanted me to\ndissect a frog.  I told them no\nway.  I said it was against my\nreligion.  I got a C.\n\nAdam frowns a little.\n\nBARBARA\nHow did you do on the math test?\n\nLydia looks down coyly.\n\nADAM\nWe studied all day yesterday.\nDon't tell me...\n\nLYDIA\nI got an A!\n\nThey grin with pride.\n\nLYDIA\n(continuing)\nSo can I?\n\nADAM\n(shaking his head)\nUh-uh.  Only if you got above a C\non science.\n\nLYDIA\nOh, go on...\n\nBARBARA\nOh, Adam, don't tease her.  You\nnever got an A in science in your\nlife!\n\nADAM\nAll right.\n\nON LYDIA -- she puts down her books.  Loosens her\ncollar, ruffles her hair and waits.\n\nADAM\n(continuing)\nOkay.\n\nLydia looks down.  Lydia begins to levitate.\n\nShe lifts her head and leaves the white bread world\nbehind!  In a voice as deep and soulful as Percy\nSledge:\n\nLYDIA\n\"When a man loves a woman.\nHe can't keep his mind on nothin' else.\"\n\nBehind her ghostly images of the football players\nappear as back-up.\n\nFOOTBALLERS\nOooooo.  Hummm oooooo.\n\nLYDIA\nHe'd change the world for the good\nthing he's found.  When a main\nneeds a woman, He cain't keep his\nmind on nothin' else.  If she's\nbad, he won't see it, she can do\nno wrong.\n\nMUSIC CONTINUES OVER:\n\n\nANGLE\n\nA great pile of sand with the whorehouse in the\nmiddle.  An irritated Betelgeuse crawls out on the\nroof.  Hating the singing he shakes his fist at the\nsky -- loses his footing and tumbles into the sand.\nTerrified, he scrambles to get out.\n\n\nON PILE\n\nA moving coil under the sand sends him scurrying inside\nagain.  The Sandworm SNAPPING right behind him as he\nruns back out on the roof.\n\n\nANGLE\n\nCAMERA TILTS UP to see house.  It is the perfect, New\nEngland house.  CAMERA PULLS BACK from the model -- out\nthe window of the real house.\n\nOutside the real house -- we see it is dilapidated, and\nundeniably, the perfect haunted house.\n\nFADE OUT.Embed"
