How are you gonna kill it? You're gonna become unsuccessful? Frank, you can be successful and have enemies, uh?\nBe unsuccessful too, and even have friends.\"\n\n[Interlude: Jay-Z]\nI got these niggas, Breezy, don't worry about it\nLet that bitch breathe!\n[Verse 1: Jay-Z]\nI used to give a fuck, now I give a fuck less\nWhat do I think of success? It sucks, too much stress\nI guess I blew up quick\n'Cause friends I grew up with\nSee me as a premie, but I'm not, and my nuts big\nI don't know what the fuss is, my career is illustrious\nMy rep is impeccable; I'm not to be fucked with, with\nShit, let that bitch breathe!\nI'm way too important to be talking about extorting\nAsking me for a portion's like asking for a coffin\nBroad daylight I'll off your on-switch\nYou're not too bright, goodnight, long kiss\nBye bye, my reply... \"BLAH, BLAH\"\nBlast burner, then pass burner to Ty-Ty\nFinish my breakfast, why?\nI got an appetite for destruction and you're a small fry\nNow where was I?\n[Break: Jay-Z]\nLet that bitch breathe!\n\n[Verse 2: Jay-Z]\nI used to give a shit, now I don't give a shit more\nTruth be told I had more fun when I was piss-poor\nI'm pissed off, and this what success is all about?\nA bunch of niggas acting like bitches with big mouths\nAll this stress, all I got is this big house\nCouple of cars, I don't bring half of them shits out\nAll of this Ace of Spade I drink just to piss out\nI mean, I like the taste, could've saved myself 6 hours\nHow many times can I go to Mr. Chow's, Tao's, Nobu?\nHold up, let me move my bowels\nI'll shit on y'all niggas, OG, tell these boys\n(Y'all ain't got shit on my nigga, aoww!)\nI got watches I ain't seen in months\nApartment at the Trump I only slept in once\nNiggas said Hova was over, such dummies\nEven if I fell I'll land on a bunch of money\nY'all ain't got nothing for me\n\n[Break: Jay-Z]\nNas, let that bitch breathe!\n[Verse 3: Nas]\nSuccess, McLaren, women staring\nMy villain appearance\nSacred blood of a king and my vein ain't spilling\nGhetto Othello, Sugar Hill Romello\nCamaro driven, I climax from paper\nThen ask: \"Why is life worth living?\"\nIs it to hunt for the shit that you want?\nTo receive's great, but I lust giving\nThe best jewelers wanna make my things\nI make Jacob shit on Lorraine just to make me a chain\nNiggas mentioned on One Love\nCame home to the paper in hand\nAin't gotta brag about the Feds, young man\nOld cribs I sold, y'all drive by like monuments\nGoogle Earth Nas; I got flats in other continents\nWorst enemies wanna be my best friends\nBest friends wanna be enemies like that's what's in\nBut I don't give a fuck, walk inside the lion's den\nTake everybody's chips, 'bout to cash them in\nUp your catalog, dog, mine's worth too much\nLike Mike Jacks ATV pub, Mottola can't touch\nLet this bitch breathe!
