Not again!\n\nAnd we hope our perceptions isn't slippin\nBut we swear to God\nWe saw Lou Reed cow tippin\nCow tippin\n\nCow tippin\nCow tippin\nCow tippin\nYou really think that was Lou Reed?\nCow tippin\nI'm sure it was, he was wearing black Levis\nCow tippin\nI thought he was a vegetarian\nCow tippin\nHe's just tippin them over, he wasn't eating them\nCow tippin\nOh\nCow tippinYou might also likeEmbed"
