And extinguish all their sunshine?\nI didn't say that I felt the same, you just took it as read\nAs I closed all the blinds and put you to bed\nAnd read you all the last rites\n\nIt serves as a warning to me, just like most of these days do\n'Cause I just wish I could've just left you there sitting in your own shit\n'Cause I know that you would me, too\nSee, cos I've trawled through all this before\nAnd I bought that skinny tee\nWith a big black gaping hole where the heart should be\nThat says, \"baby, I renounce thee\"\nDon't you die on me now\n\nThat kiss is now a circus show\nThat big top tent and neon glow\nThrough spectacles\nOf rainbow red\nYou never feel\nYour love 'til it's dead\n\nYeah\n\nArm's length keep him\nI stab but don't injure\nNo blood ever poured\nEmpty as a hole and ever depleting\n\nOne and four makes us whole\nA bankruptcy of love\nCannot swim above\nEmpty as a hole and ever depleting\n\nI recoil from the blast\nAnd look around me though\nNeither friend nor foe\nEmpty as a hole and ever depletingYou might also likeEmbed"
