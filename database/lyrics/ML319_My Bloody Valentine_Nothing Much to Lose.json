Why? Why?\"\nToo late\n\n[Verse 3]\nPlease you\nOh, I know what to do\nA soft salt taste\nDo you see me as a fool?\n\n[Chorus 3]\nCan I look, look, look?\nOh, the things you took\nEyes asked, \"Why? Why? Why?\"\nToo late\nI'll come down, down, down\nOh, you don't know what you found\nDon't, don't walk, walk, walk awayYou might also like3Embed"
