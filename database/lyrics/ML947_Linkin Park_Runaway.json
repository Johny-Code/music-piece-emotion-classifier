(Gonna run away, gonna run away)\nMind! (Gonna run away, gonna run away)\nMind! (Gonna run away, gonna run away)\nYou might also like[Chorus: Chester Bennington]\nI wanna run away, never say goodbye\nI wanna know the truth instead of wondering why\nI wanna know the answers, no more lies\nI wanna shut the door and open up my mind\n\n[Outro: Chester Bennington]\nI wanna run away and open up my mind\nI wanna run away and open up my mind\nI wanna run away and open up my mind\nI wanna run away and open up my mind21Embed"
