My uncle, he was mad!\n\nSo let's celebrate I'm feeling great\nI'm the guy that found the Lost chord\n\nYou know it wasn't easy finding that Lost chord\nWorking in my attic I didn't sleep for days and days\nI'd be in terrible shape if I hadn't slept nights!\nFirst I put an A flat with a B minor\nThen I put a B minor with and F major\nThen I put and F minor with a B major\nThen I tried an A and a B and a B and a C\nAnd a C and a D and a D and E and an E and a F\nAnd a F and a G; What a piano no apostrophe's !\n\nAnd this is what I came up with (plays wrong chord)\nYou might also likeWhat's happened that isn't the chord (plays wrong chord)\nNeither is that (plays wrong chord)\nNeither is that (plays wrong chord)\nAnd neither is that! I lost the chord a catatstrophe\nI'm gonna sit down on the keyboard of this piano until the chord is return\n\n(sits down bum plays the right chord)\n\nThat's it the lost chord! I found it, I found by sitting on the piano keyboard\nStrange I usually play by ear!\n\nSo let's celebrate I'm feeling great\nI'm the guy that found the Lost chordEmbed"
