Back down memory lane\nI see us standing there, such a happy, happy pair\nLove beyond compare, look a-there, look a-there\n\n[Hook]\nThe way you held me\nNo one could tell me\nThat love would die\n[Verse 2]\nWhy did I have to find this photograph? I thought I had forgot the past\nNow I'm slipping fast, back down memory lane\nI feel the happiness, I feel the pain\nHere am I, back down memory lane\nI'm in the sunshine, I'm in the rain\nI thought it was over, here I go again\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Bridge/Verse 3]\nI don't wanna go\nTravel up and down\nFaster that the speed of sound\nBack down memory lane\nYou steal my foolish heart\nDon't let this feeling start\nBack down memory lane\nI don't wanna go\nBack down memory lane\nSave me, save me\nBack down memory lane\nSave me, save me, save me, save me, save me, save me\nBack down memory lane\nBack down memory lane\nBack down memory lane\nBack down memory lane\nI don't, I know\nI know, I don't know, know, know, knowYou might also like2Embed"
