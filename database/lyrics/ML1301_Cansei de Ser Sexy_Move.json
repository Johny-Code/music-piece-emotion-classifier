Get up!\nYou gotta keep on moving\nGet up! Get up! Get up! Get up!\nYou gotta keep on moving\n\n[Verse 1]\nIf I could jump backwards straight to the dance floor\nWill you still be waiting for me?\nWill you still be my friend?\nI don\u2019t wanna bug you out with crazy crazy ideas\nFor I know this ain\u2019t a good place for us to talk\n[Chorus]\nYou better get your move on...\nOr all the good ones, will have gone\n\n[Refrain]\nGet up! Get up! Get up! Get up!\nYou gotta keep on moving\nGet up! Get up! Get up! Get up!\nYou gotta keep on moving\nGet up! Get up! Get up! Get up!\nYou gotta keep on moving\nGet up! Get up! Get up! Get up!\nYou gotta keep on moving\n\n[Verse 2]\nIf you want to say goodbye\nIf you want to play seek and hide\nDo you still got the time?\nDo you really need to be on time?\nIf there\u2019s nothing that you like\nEverybody is so so free outside\nThere\u2019s no need for playing nice\nDo you know what?\n\n[Chorus]\nYou better get your move on...\nOr all the good ones, will have gone\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nAll the stars are about to die\nBut you don\u2019t need to have insights\nI don\u2019t want to change your life\nSo please, hold me tight tonight\nWe could really use a cab\nDon\u2019t go out and crash your car\nI don\u2019t mind being yesterday\nJust take me again...\n\n[Chorus]\nYou better get your move on...\nOr all the good ones, will have gone\n\n[Rap]\nIf someone drops you on the floor\nAnd you just don\u2019t know who did it\nJust flick your hair and try to kick\nAs many people as you can hit!\nYou gotta do what you gotta do\nBut please listen to me:\nDon\u2019t let no one play you a fool\nLike throwing a stinky drink at youEmbed"
