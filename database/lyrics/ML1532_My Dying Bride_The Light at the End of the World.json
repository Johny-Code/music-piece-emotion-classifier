        "lyrics": "The Light at the End of the World LyricsAn isle, a bright shining isle\nStands forever, alone in the sea\nOf rock and of sand and grass\nAnd shale, the isle bereft of trees\n\n- Small. A speck in the wide blue\nSea. 'Tis the last of all the land\nA dweller upon our lonesome\nIsle, the last, lonely man? -\n\nBy the Gods he is there to\nNever leave, to remain all his\nLife. His punishment for\nEvermore, to attend the\nEternal light\nThe lighthouse, tall and brilliant\nWhite, which stands at the end\nOf the world. Protecting ships\nAnd sailors too, from rock they\nCould be hurled\n\nYet nothing comes and nothing\nGoes 'sept the bright blue sea\nWhich stretches near and far\nAway, 't is all our man can see\n\nThough, one day, up high on\nRock, a bird did perch and cry\nAn albatross, he shot a glance\nAnd wondered deeply, why?\n\nCould it be a watcher sent?\nA curse sent from the Gods\nWho sits and cries and stares at him\nThe life that they have robbed\n\nEach year it comes to watch\nOver him, the creature from above\nNot a curse but a reminder of\nThe woman that he loved\nYou might also like- Oh weary night, under stars\nHe'd lay and gaze\nUp towards the moon and stars\nThe suns dying haze\n\nTime and again, Orion's light\nFilled our man with joy\nWithin the belt, he'd see his love\nRemembering her voice -\n\nThe twinkle from the stars above\nBled peace into his heart\nAs long as she looks down on him\nHe knows they'll never part\n\nOne day good, one day bad\nThe madness, the heat, the sun\nOut to sea, he spies upon land\nHis beloved Albion\n\nCliffs of white and trees of green\nChildren run and play\n'My home land' he cries and weeps\nWhy so far away?\n\nEyes sore and red. Filled with tears\nHe runs towards the sea\nTo risk his life, a worthy cause\nFor home he would be\nInto the sea, deep and blue\nThe waters wash him clean\nAwake. He screams. Cold with sweat\nAnd Albion a dream\n\n- Such is life upon the isle\nOf torment and woe\nOne day good. One day bad\nAnd some days, even hope\n\nThe light at the end of the world\nBurns bright for mile and mile\nYet tends the man, its golden glow\nIn misery all the while?\n\nFor fifty years he stands and waits\nAtop the light, alone\nLooking down upon his isle\nThe Gods have made his home -\n\nThe watcher at the end of the world\nThrough misery does defile\nRemembers back to that single night\nAnd allows a tiny smile\n\n(His sacrifice was not so great\nHe insists upon the world\nAgain he would crime\nAgain he would pay\nFor one moment with the girl)\n\nHer hair, long and black it shone\nThe dark, beauty of her eyes\nOlive skin and warm embrace\nHer memory never dies\n\n'Twas years ago, he\nRemembers clear\nThe life they once did live\nEndless love and lust for life\nThey promised each would give\n\nAlas, such love and laughter too\nWas short as panting breath\nFor one dark night, her soul\nWas kissed\nBy the shade of death\n\n(Agony, like none before\nWas suffered by our man.)\nWho tends the light now\nBurning bright\nOn the very last of land\n\n(Anger raged and misery too\nLike nothing ever before.)\nHe cursed the Gods and man\nAnd life\nAnd at his heart he tore\n\n- A deity felt sympathy\nAnd threw our man a light\n'Your woman you may see again\nFor a single night. -\n\nBut think hard and well young man\nThere is a price to pay:\nTo tend the light at the end of\nThe world\nIs where you must stay\n\nAway from man and life and love\nAlone you will be\nOn a tiny isle. A bright shining isle\nIn the middle of the sea.'\n\n- 'I'll tend the light, for one more night\nWith the woman whom I love'\nScreamed the man, with tearful eyes\nTo the deity above\n\nAnd so it was that very night\nHis lover did return\nTo his arms and to their bed\nTogether they did turn\n\nIn deepest love and lust and passion\nEntwined they did fall\nLost within each other's arms\nThey danced (in lover's ball). -\n\n- Long was the night filled with love\nFor them the world was done\nAwoke he did to brightest light\nHis woman and life had gone\n\nTo his feet he leapt. To the sea he looked\nTo the lighthouse on the stone\nThe price is paid and from now on\nHe lives forever alone\n\nFifty years have passed since then\nAnd not a soul has he seen\nBut his woman lives with him still\nIn every single dream\n\n'Tis sad to hear how young love has died\nTo know that, alone, someone has cried\nBut memories are ours to keep\nTo live them again, in our sleep.-Embed"
