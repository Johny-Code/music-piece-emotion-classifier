End of beautiful illusions\nBroken pieces will not mend\nOne last kiss to save our past now\n\n[Chorus]\nI'll lose myself in anguish for tonight\nHelp me get over you\nOne last false apology\nHelp me get over you\n\n[Bridge]\nNow we must let go\nUrgency overwhelms me as I must restrain my flood of tears\nI refuse to be slave to your false beauty again\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI'll lose myself in anguish for tonight\nHelp me get over you\nOne last false apology\nHelp me get over you\n\n[Outro]\nIn my mind blood drips from your eyes\nA beautiful last goodbye3Embed"
