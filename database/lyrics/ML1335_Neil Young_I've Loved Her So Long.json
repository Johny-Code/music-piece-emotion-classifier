With wings to fly\nShe rolls along doing it wrong\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, I've loved her so long\nOh, I've loved her so long\n[Bridge]\nThere's a place that I know we could go\nGet away for a while\nI can bring her the peace that she needs\nGive her reason to smile\n\n[Outro]\nOh, I've loved her so long\nOh, I've loved her so long\nOh, I've loved her so long\nOh, I've loved her so long\nOh, I've loved her so long\nOh, I've loved her so long\nOh, I've loved her so long\nOh, I've loved her so long\nOh, I've loved her so long\nOh, I've loved her so long\nOh, I've loved her so long\nOh, I've loved her so longYou might also like2Embed"
